Apple has eliminated so many annoying little hang-ups that you might run into when using the old one. The GPS pinpoints to meters instead of blocks. The 3G connection slashes web loading times by minutes to seconds. The more rounded case feels great in the hand. And most importantly the new software polishes the OS and opens the phone up to nearly unlimited capabilities through the countless programs that are already being written by the brilliant legions of faithful developers. It''s kind of cool.

If you want to cut to the chase, the software is what we''re most excited about—so much that we ran the first half of this review earlier extolling the iPhone 2.0 virtues in detail, including the fact that it''s a free upgrade for the people who snapped up the first iPhone, perhaps before it was ready.

On the software side, the iPhone has the most advanced touchscreen OS out there today. Scrolling, dialing, panning, zooming, touching and pinching are all actions you can do to get around your photos, your maps, your movies, your music and of course, your phone calls. The iPhone 2.0 update improves on the already great communication features such as desktop-class email and web browsing by adding MobileMe and Exchange support—both of which push emails to your phone as soon as they''re received, just like on the BlackBerry. These two new additions also allow your phone to always sync contacts and calendar events with your computer or your office''s system directly over the air, without ever needing to dock, or take any action. There''s also the App Store, which gives you access to a gigantic library of third-party applications to add features such as controlling your iTunes, instant messaging, 3D gaming and To Do lists. One drawback is that Apple may not support the cool (illegal) apps like the NES emulators and video recording programs that don''t work through the SDK. Lots of unofficial third party apps may never make it to the store. One, Instinctiv, a super iPhone music shuffle app, was recently denied store sales because it is against the terms of agreement to enhance the iPod or iPhone music playback in any way. Huh?! Apps also take a long time (minutes) to install and uninstall, and backups now take awhile longer than before. Annoying, but still worth the wait.

The fact that the free software''s advantages are available on the original iPhone means that the reduced subsidized price $199 for the 8GB and $299 for the 16GB are good, but maybe not good enough to justify a trade-in. (The $10 extra a month for 3G access is a wash, frankly.) Quite a conundrum for those of you tempted.

Onto the hardware. Let''s start with the husk: Once, I sat down on a twisted key, putting a giant scar across the aluminum back of my iPhone. With that one exception aside, my iPhone''s abused-to-hell case still looks strong and shiny.

The new case is made of smudge-able plastic, and last time I checked geek material lust hierarchy, plastic was a distant ranking of 452342 places behind aluminum. The effect is that the case, feels lighter, warmer and thicker but also cheaper than before. And in your hand, picking up a slightly warm iPhone, it feels almost more organic. Between that and the the rounded shape, which fits far better in the hand, it''s like you''re cupping a warm baby bird. The old phone by comparison feels like its a better quality device, with the spiritual heft of a German machine. The new case is lighter but actually thicker; still, it feels less significant and durable. The case did survive being put in a bag full of keys and rubbed vigorously. Only some of the silver Apple logo on the back got visibly scratched. The case is also a lot easier to send radio waves through than the previous case—useful as this phone has many more radios—although reception improvement was not noticeable. [UPDATE: Actually, it is much better, in both EDGE and 3G mode] Also, if you place the new model on a table, it rocks when you tap the screen, so you can''t use it as a table top computer anymore. And the case is very easy to smudge. The black color is available in both sizes, but the white only comes in pricier 16GB, much to the chagrin of boyfriends who promised to buy their significant others one in the pale tint.

The screen is slightly warmer in color temperature (more yellow than blue), slightly brighter (even when considering decay over time) and the daylight viewing is better, but it''s the same 3.5-inch, 480x320 resolution screen. And it''s still gorgeous.

Oh, the headphone jack isn''t recessed anymore, so you can use whatever headphones or adapters you want. And the lock and volume buttons are recessed slightly more and are metal. The speakers and earpiece have a metal grill behind them. All this, to great effect.

To mention the 3G is to bring up painful memories, the time I''ve lost waiting for web pages to load on the iPhone, or standing on street corners waiting for maps to load.

Our tests in AT&T''s aggressively built-out NYC area showed the 3G connection is 4.8 times faster than the old EDGE connection. When you turn off 3G and do an EDGE-to-EDGE test between older and newer models, they both perform the same. The GPRS (850, 900, 1800, 1900) and UMTS/HSDPA (850, 1900 and 2100 MHz) cellular radios have the advantage of some design improvements, including the use of the steel ring around the screen as an antenna and the electronic transparency of the now all plastic back.

Wi-Fi reception is better. In a side-by-side test with the old iPhone, we walked away from an access point, the old iPhone''s connection died at 100 feet and the newer one lasted to about 120 feet. And there''s a new Airplane mode that turns off cellular but powers up Wi-Fi for airline internet.

At the end of a day with lots of email and browser use, or media playback, my old iPhone would be begging for a serious dock charge. How does the iPhone''s 3G connection affect that?



The downside of such speedy downloads is a reduced battery life, something the original couldn''t stand to lose much of. We''re do more testing of that soon. But here''s an interesting thing: According to the data out there, the iPhone 3G has better battery life using 3G than the old iPhone does using EDGE. Let me explain. Apple''s official browsing battery life rating on Wi-Fi is 6 hours for both models. They never rated the EDGE battery life but most testers found it to be about 25% less than Wi-Fi. That''s 4.5 hours. The iPhone 3G rating is 5 hours of browsing. Apple is claiming that it''s 5 hours for both the new iPhone 3G and the EDGE on the old one. We shall investigate such claims soon. But I wish Apple would take me up on my idea for using the 3G only for active browsing, maps and certain apps that need it, dynamically switching to EDGE for IMing, email downloading and weather checking.

UPDATE: Battery life has been noted to drain very quickly, but because I find myself using the phone a lot more often thanks to the added usefulness of apps. 3D gaming is also a killer on battery, far worse than anyone has claimed so far, thanks to the constant use of CPU, GPU and LCD backlight. Here is a roundup of nine battery tests taken from the best reviews, averaging about 5 hours for 3G talk (good) and 3-5 hours for "mixed use". Regardless of life, here are some tips on increasing iPhone 3G endurance and some gadgets that can help extend battery life.

Phone-wise, I decided to lower my minute plan. I completely have stopped using my old iPhone for voice in San Francisco''s spotty network, and even when I''m connected, everyone sounds like they have marbles in their mouth. Network problems aside, the good news is that basic voice quality issues have been fixed.

Doing side-by-side calls, the difference when using the new phone and old is like the difference between talking to someone with their hand over their mouth and with their hand taken away. While the new iPhone''s speaker and mic definitely improve sound quality, it seems packets do matter too. When the the phone is running on a 3G network (in downtown NY), calls sound especially clear compared to the old iPhone. But when both iPhones are on EDGE, the call difference is noticeable, but not night and day. Even the speakerphone''s audio is much louder and so, music played through the mono speaker is also improved. As for reception back in spotty coverage areas, I''ll have to do a side-by-side soon to let you know how that goes. UPDATE: I could make no calls before in my house. Now I can, in both EDGE and 3G mode, with good (not great clarity). This is fantastic.

The old iPhone''s location detector was accurate within a few blocks, using Skyhook''s system of logging cellular towers and Wi-Fi spot MAC addresses and pairing them with physical addreses. I thought it was fine for making sure when I searched for an ATM machine, it would only return local results. The new A-GPS system is accurate within meters, though, opening up the iPhone to more useful location-based apps, maps and geotagging of photos.

The A-GPS helps get quicker fixes in the city, compared with a typical PND. However it doesn''t refresh as quickly (every 5 to 15 steps), and won''t give you a "heading-up" view, so when you''re walking, it takes a bit longer to figure out where you''re going. This is clearly optimized for walking, though in a pinch it could help lost drivers. The greater accuracy isn''t the only reason it''s better than the older iPhone: The ability to track your path is a nice enhancement too. The time to GPS lock is between 1 and 10 seconds, using a combination of Wi-Fi and cellular as well as GPS. But don''t even think about using this for regular car nav: there is no voice prompting, nor is there automatic turn-by-turn.

Apple didn''t write a dedicated turn-by-turn navigator for driving, with voice, but now we hear that companies are making them, so we look forward to revisiting this once real navi apps are out.

The old iPhone''s software can take a photo and email it or send it to a MobileMe gallery, but the camera itself is relatively weak. It won''t capture video, and I''ve lost countless YouTube hits by not having a video device at the ready. This situation has not been improved much.

UPDATE: One nice thing we''ve finally confirmed is that the dreaded buzz you got with speakers and tape adapters too close to the iPhone with the GSM connection running during calls or data disappears when you''re running 3G.

The new camera has the same 2MP shooter which returns 1600 x 1200 pixels. There still isn''t video capture. Image processing seems to be slightly less grainy but it''s not something you would notice. The MP count would be fine, but the low-light quality is still terrible. Nokia and Motorola have built thin phones with better imaging, why not Apple? And Apple''s forte is software, so why can''t they beef up the software tools, by adding image stabilizers and noise reducers, not to mention Photo Booth-type frames and effects?

Inside the box: A new smaller USB charger the size of an ice cube, headphones, a sync cable and a SIM eject tool. There is no longer a dock included to use with the cable.

This is really not a revolutionary phone. It''s more like the iPhone we wished Apple made last year. But basics, like cut, copy and paste are still missing. (As is MMS, thanks for the reminder, commenters.) As well are the ability to use the phone like a hard drive. Other than that, we''re hoping for some more revolutionary changes to come by software update. And let''s take a moment to remember how many developers are making killer iPhone programs right this second. There''s the revolution.

So the hardware is interesting in the iPhone 3G, but the real story here is the new iPhone OS 2.0 firmware, which we''ve written about in depth here. You manage to install that, old iPhone users, you''ve got about 80% of this new iPhone''s mojo.

It’s the first Nokia device to ship with the company’s new e-mail user interface – making multiple accounts easy to manage — as well as full integration of e-mail and messaging.

The Nokia E75 smartphone for business users has arrived in stores.   It’s the first Nokia device to ship with the company’s new e-mail user interface, which offers a standard desktop e-mail experience — one-click reply, subfolders, HTML support, the ability to open attachments — on a 4.8-ounce device running Symbian S60 third edition software.   The E75 is an enterprise-focused device, and so there’s support for Mail for Microsoft Exchange and IBM Lotus Notes Traveler, but the same account can also host accounts from consumer services such as Yahoo Mail, Google Gmail and Microsoft Windows Live Hotmail. 
For easy e-mailing, a full qwerty keyboard slides out from behind a 2.4-inch QVGA screen, which can be customized for two different home screen modes, for those wanting to better differentiate between work and play.   The quad-band phone supports GSM and WCDMA connectivity (850/900/1800/1900, WCDMA, 850/1900/2100 HSDPA) as well as VOIP (voice over IP) over WLAN.    There’s Bluetooth 2.0 inside, 5 MB of internal dynamic memory, a microSD slot for 16 GB more, the Nokia Maps A-GPS navigation application, music and media players, an FM radio and a 3.2-megabyte camera with red-eye reduction, LED flash and eight-times digital zoom.

  [4;36;1mBackground Update (0.4ms)[0m   [0;1mUPDATE "backgrounds" SET "data" = 'The 5800 XpressMusic (aka Tube) is the first touchscreen Symbian S60 phone from Nokia—a surprising fact considering how prominent touchscreens have quickly become over the last few years. And instead of rolling out the new touch-specific S60 Fifth Edition on a flagship N-series phone, Nokia has decided to position the 5800 as a music phone for the kiddies, packaging it with their all-you-can-eat (and keep) Comes With Music service. This choice is probably a brilliant one, because after our quick demo, this thing needs a bit more time in the oven before it can stand with the big guys for a touchscreen-only device.
For a mid-range music phone with touch, though, the 5800 is pretty well equipped: 640x360 touchscreen with haptic response, Wi-Fi, A-GPS, 3G on the 850/1900 MHz band (works with AT&T here in the States), 3.2MP camera with Zeiss lens, and an 8GB microSD card for music in the box. But while the touchscreen is sharp and bright, it''s resistive rather than capacitive, which means instead of accurately picking up the light zap of electricity from your fingertips, it registers where two thin layers of the screen get pushed together under your finger.
On the prototype we played with briefly, it''s much harder to get touches to register, and far less accurate than the iPhone''s capacitive screens. The 5800 packs a built-in stylus for this reason—you''ll be using it a lot. Text entry can be done with a full-screen QWERTY, a mini-QWERTY for the stylus, T9 on a touch dialpad, or using handwriting recognition w/ stylus. It''s almost exactly like what''s found on Nokia''s touchscreen internet tablets like the N810, which makes sense, since Nokia recently folded the tablet group in with the smartphone folks to help develop touch features for S60 v5.
Other touch-specific additions are a new Contacts bar similar to T-Mobile''s myfaves that can replace application shortcuts—giving quick access to calling or texting your four favorite folks, as well as the option to add an RSS feed of that person''s blog or Twitter updates. Application menus also appear on a nice translucent overlay in most applications instead of Symbian''s usual pop-up lists, making the camera much easier to operate while switching options, for instance. And a dedicated button on the upper right brings up the Media Bar, which gives quick touch access to the music player, camera, contacts, and web browser at any time.If you''re used to Symbian''s browser, you''ll fit right at home with the touch version. Basically touching replaces the scrolling cursor for zooming and scrolling a page. It''s a pretty solid experience, although pages still tend to load their mobile versions by default like in S60 v4.
For music the device looks capable—there''s a 3.5mm headphone jack thank God, and 8GB of space on the included 8GB microSD. In the States, the 5800''s price (which is not yet set, but the Euro version is €279/$389) will include a year of Comes With Music downloads, which can then be kept. Going beyond Nokia''s proprietary sync software (for iTunes, etc) will be like in any other Symbian phone—not super convenient. Comes With Music allows you to sync albums grabbed on the web to your device over 3G, though, which is nice.
The 5800 seems like a solid mid-level touch phone for music—especially if Comes With Music pans out as a cool service. But don''t plan on using this thing for heavy emailing or texting—you''ll probably be using T9 text entry with the touch dialpad or the stylus for most of your text entry unless you have the patience of a monk, which kind of defeats the point for an all-touch device these days. Look for it hitting before the end of the year for an as-yet-undisclosed price.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:45' WHERE "id" = 17[0m

T-Mobile teased us at CES 2009 by introducing the RIM BlackBerry Curve 8900 but denying us any details on availability date and pricing. Fortunately, we didn''t have to wait too long as the carrier has released the final details and has given us our own review unit.

In short, the BlackBerry Curve 8900 is a solid addition to T-Mobile''s smartphone lineup and one of the company''s top offerings, in our opinion. It replaces the Curve 8300 series, and brings several notable improvements, including a sleeker design that''s bolstered by a more solid construction and an amazingly sharp display, a faster processor, a full HTML Web browser, and a 3.2-megapixel camera. It also has integrated Wi-Fi with UMA support so you can make unlimited calls over a Wi-Fi network. However, our one big disappointment is the lack of 3G support. It''s a feature that could really have given the 8900 an edge over its competition.

Despite this omission and some other minor issues, we would absolutely recommend the BlackBerry Curve 8900. It''s a solid device that will appeal to both consumers and mobile professionals, offering a nice balance between work and play and all wrapped up in a sweet little package. The BlackBerry Curve 8900 is available now through B2B sales and will be in retail stores nationwide starting February 11 for $199 with a two-year contract.

Design
The RIM BlackBerry Curve 8900 holds the distinction (though who knows for how long) as being the thinnest full QWERTY BlackBerry to date. The smartphone measures 4.2 inches tall by 2.3 inches wide by 0.5 inch thick and weighs 3.8 ounces compared with the BlackBerry Curve 8320, which comes it at 4.2 inches high by 2.4 inches wide by 0.6 inch thick and 3.9 ounces. It feels comfortable to use a both a phone and messaging device and fit into a pants pocket. We do appreciate the Curve 8900''s sleek profile but even more than that, we''re fans of the phone''s more solid construction. Though the phone''s body is still made of plastic, RIM used different finishes and paint applications to make the handset more durable and you can notice the difference as soon as you pick it up. Our only complaint would be that the battery cover can sometimes shift a little.


The BlackBerry Curve 8900 offers a sleeker and more solid design compared with the Curve 8300 series.
Also, while style is subjective, we have to say we dig the look of the Curve 8900 over the previous Curve 8300 series. It has tapered edges like the BlackBerry Storm and the metallic paint gives the 8900 a fresh, modern. It''s a lot less corporate and masculine looking than the BlackBerry Bold, so it should appeal to a wide variety of users.

The Curve 8900 features a 2.4-inch TFT LCD that supports 65,536 colors at a 480x360-pixel resolution. It''s a better screen than the BlackBerry Bold, which isn''t too shabby itself with a 480x320-pixel resolution, but there is an extra level of sharpness and brightness to the Curve''s screen that''s quite impressive. The Curve 8900 also runs the latest version of the BlackBerry operating system so you get an updated user interface. There''s no doubt the UI is more aesthetically pleasing, but we do have one minor complaint: a lot of icons look the same, so it''s a bit hard to distinguish different folders and applications onscreen just at a glance.

Below the display, you have your standard navigation array that includes Talk and End keys, a menu shortcut, a back button, and the trackball navigator. The layout is simple and spacious, so there were no problems using the controls or navigating the phone. The side controls, which are outlined below, also allows for easy one-handed operation.


The Curve 8900''s keyboard is similar to the BlackBerry Bold''s. Though it''s smaller, we still found it easy to use.
The BlackBerry Curve 8900''s keyboard is similar to the one found on the BlackBerry Bold. Since the phone is smaller, the keys aren''t as big or roomy but we still found it easy to compose e-mails and text with minimal errors. The buttons provide a nice tactile feedback and the keyboard is adequately backlit, with the number keys highlighted in red instead of white.

On the left side, there''s a single user-programmable shortcut key (launches voice dialer by default), while there''s a 3.5mm headphone jack, a volume rocker, a MicroUSB port, and another customizable side button (assigned to the camera out of the box). The camera and flash are located on the back, and behind the battery cover are the SIM card and microSD expansion slots. We would have preferred that the expansion slot be on the outside for easier access, and we also weren''t huge fans of the little plastic piece that held the card in place. It felt flimsy, so we worry if it''ll hold up over time. Finally, while not immediately visible, there''s a mute button and a lock key on top the unit.

T-Mobile ships the Curve 8900 with a travel charger, a USB cable, a 256MB MicroSD card, a wired headset, a protective case, a software CD, and reference material. For more add-ons, please check our cell phone accessories, ringtones, and help page.

Features
The RIM BlackBerry Curve 8900 runs BlackBerry OS 4.6.1.114 so aside from the aforementioned updated user interface, you also get new functionality and improved applications. For example, unlike the Curve 8300 series, you can now edit Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files, thanks to the inclusion of DataViz''s Documents to Go Suite. Like the Bold and the Storm, only the Standard Edition is preloaded on the smartphone so if you want the ability to create new documents, you will have to upgrade to the Premium Edition.

The BlackBerry Curve 8900 also ships with a number of personal information management tools, such as a Calendar, a task list, a memo pad, a voice recorder, a calculator, a password keeper, and more. There''s quite a catalog of applications available for BlackBerrys, whether you''re looking for new games or software for your job. Be aware, however, that if you have third-party applications on an older BlackBerry model, they may not be compatible with the Curve 8900. T-Mobile includes some suggestions and direct download links on its mobile site, or you can check out Download.com for more ideas.

One of the most-needed improvements was in the area of Web browsing, and the Curve 8900 delivers. You now get a full HTML Web browser with support for RSS feeds and streaming media, including YouTube clips. Browsing and navigating sites is made better by the Page and Column view options and onscreen cursor. There are also zoom in/out functions. The experience hardly matches the Web experience on the iPhone, but it''s a definite improvement from previous versions of the BlackBerry browser, which was pretty much atrocious. Baby steps, right?

To get connected, you have two options: Wi-Fi or T-Mobile''s EDGE network, which is all well and good but what''s more newsworthy to us, is what''s missing: 3G support. We realize that the addition of a 3G radio affects battery life and size, but still, T-Mobile has finally rolled out its 3G network and could use more 3G smartphones (currently, the T-Mobile G1 is the carrier''s only smartphone to offer 3G). Admittedly, we found that surfing the Web on the Curve 8900 over EDGE wasn''t that bad but even so, we still would have liked to see the inclusion of 3G.

Fortunately, you do get Wi-Fi as an alternative, and the other upside of the integrated Wi-Fi is UMA support. This means you can make and receive unlimited calls over a wireless network and not have the minutes deducted from your cellular plan. The caveat is that you will need to sign for T-Mobile''s Unlimited HotSpot Calling plan, which starts at $9.99 per month on top of an existing T-Mobile plan.

Other voice features of the BlackBerry Curve 8900 include quad-band world roaming, a speakerphone, voice-activated dialing, smart dialing, conference calling, speed dial, and text and multimedia messaging. The address book is limited only by the available memory (the SIM card holds an additional 250 contacts) with room in each entry for multiple phone numbers, e-mail addresses, work and home addresses, job title, and more. For caller ID purposes, you can assign each contact a photo, a group ID, or a custom ringtone.

Like most of the carrier''s handsets, the Curve 8900 supports T-Mobile''s MyFaves service, giving you unlimited calls to five contacts, regardless of carrier. Individual plans for MyFaves start at $39.99 a month. You also get Bluetooth 2.0 with support for mono and stereo Bluetooth wireless headsets, hands-free kits, and dial-up networking.

GPS is built in, using both satellites and cellular triangulation to find your position. You can get maps and text-based, turn-by-turn driving directions with applications such as BlackBerry Maps, which is preloaded on the Curve 8900, and Google Maps for Mobile, but if you want any real-time tracking and voice-guided instructions, you''ll have to use a location-based service like TeleNav GPS Navigator.

The BlackBerry Curve 8900''s built-in media player can play various music and video formats, including MP3, WMA9/WMA9 Pro/WMA20, AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, AMR-NB, and MIDI music files, and MPEG4, WMV, DivX4, DivX5/6 (partial support), XviD (partial), and H.263 video clips. There''s a search function, playlist creation, shuffle and repeat, and you get a full-screen mode for video playback. The included software CD also contains a copy of Roxio Easy Media Creator, so you can create MP3s from CDs and add audio tags as well as the BlackBerry Media Sync application so you can load your iTunes library. The Curve has 256MB onboard Flash memory while the expansion slot can accept up to 16GB cards.


The BlackBerry Curve 8900 is equipped with 3.2-megapixel camera and flash.
The Curve''s camera gets upgraded to a 3.2-megapixel lens (from 2 megapixels) with video recording capabilities, flash, auto focus, 2x zoom, and image stabilization. In camera mode, you get a choice of three picture sizes and three picture qualities. There are white balance settings, and you can add various effects to your photos, such as black and white, and sepia. With the built-in GPS, you can also geotag photos. The camcorder records clips in two formats (normal and MMS) with sound and offers a video light and color effects.


The Curve took decent photos in well-lit rooms, but had some problems in darker environments.
Picture quality was good, as long as we were snapping shots in well-lit areas. Even with the flash or in night mode, we had a hard time getting a photo that didn''t look dark or completely blown out by the flash. We also noticed a bit of shutter lag, so be sure not to move to quickly away from the scene after pressing the capture button. Video quality wasn''t the best as clips looked pretty grainy, but you can still make out the objects and scenery so it''ll be fine if there''s a moment that you absolutely must get on film and don''t have access to a camcorder.

Despite all these other features, e-mail remains the heart and soul of the BlackBerry. The BlackBerry Curve 8900 can sync with your company''s BlackBerry Enterprise server, with support for Microsoft Exchange, IBM Lotus Domino, or Novell GroupWise, to deliver corporate e-mail in real time. There''s also an attachment viewer for opening Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Corel WordPerfect, PDF, JPEG, GIF, and more. With BlackBerry Internet Service, you can also access up to 10 personal/business POP3 or IMAP4 e-mail accounts. Set up is nearly instantaneous; we simply input our Yahoo log in and password, and within a couple of seconds, we received a message that activation was successful. The smartphone also comes preloaded with several instant messaging clients, including Yahoo, AIM, Windows Live, and Google Talk.

Performance
We tested the quad-band (850/900/1800/1900; GPRS/EDGE) RIM BlackBerry Curve 8900 in San Francisco using T-Mobile service and call quality was satisfactory. There was some minimal background noise that made audio quality a little less pristine than some other smartphones we''ve tested, but nothing that prevented us from having a conversation or using an airline''s voice automated system. There''s an Enhance Audio option where you can boost the treble or bass, but we didn''t find a noticeable difference. Our friends reported a couple instances of warbled audio, but otherwise no major complaints. We didn''t experience any dropped calls during our review period. The speakerphone was also OK. There was plenty of volume, but there was some hollowness to the audio, making it sound as if our callers were talking in an empty room. We successfully paired the Curve 8900 with the Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth headset and the Motorola S9 Bluetooth Active Headphones.

The BlackBerry Curve 8900 is equipped with a 512MHz processor and is a fairly responsive device. There were some instances of sluggishness; for example, we encountered some lag when we were trying to access our photo gallery and a couple of times when we launched the camera. It wasn''t anything that stopped us in our tracks or left us completely frustrated, and overall, we''re pleased with the general performance.

The Curve 8900''s speaker can''t rival the BlackBerry Bold''s rich output, but most of you will probably be listening to your music through headphones anyway, so it''s a not a huge issue. Using the handset''s 3.5mm jack, we plugged in a pair of Bose On-Ear headphones for a MP3-like music-listening experience. Video playback was quite impressive. We checked out a couple of clips, including an MP4 file, and found playback to be smooth and the picture looked great on the Curve''s high-resolution screen. We also watched a couple of YouTube clips from the Web browser, which looked very mushy and blurry, but that''s more about a video quality issue than a Curve issue.

Our review unit had no problem finding and connecting to our Wi-Fi network. On EDGE speeds, it took the smartphone about a minute to fully load CNET''s Web site, while it took about 15 to 20 seconds to load CNN''s and ESPN''s mobile sites. Though we weren''t hooked up with TeleNav GPS Navigator for real-time navigation, the Curve''s GPS radio was able to pinpoint our location within a couple of minutes on BlackBerry Maps.

The BlackBerry Curve 8900 features a 1,400mAh lithium ion battery with a rated talk time of 5.5 hours and up to 14.5 days of standby time. In our battery drain tests, we were able to get 8.5 hours of continuous talk time from the Curve 8900 on a single charge. According to FCC radiation tests, the BlackBerry Curve 8900 has a digital SAR rating of 1.01 watts per kilogram.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:45' WHERE "id" = 23[0m

The CDMA version of the RIM BlackBerry Pearl is finally out, and though it''s been a long wait (the original, GSM version debuted more than a year ago), we have to say it was worth the extra time.

You see, the RIM BlackBerry Pearl 8130 keeps the same compact and sexy design of its predecessor yet manages to pack in even more features. There''s built-in GPS, added video-recording capabilities, and an improved Web browser. In addition, you get EV-DO support and a 2-megapixel camera.

We had some minor complaints, namely that the SureType keyboard requires a learning curve and that call quality can be slightly spotty at times. However, the new additions, coupled with the tried-and-true BlackBerry messaging functions, make the RIM BlackBerry Pearl 8130 an attractive choice for consumers and professionals looking for a sleek all-in-one device. The silver model is available now through Verizon Wireless for $199.99 with a two-year contract and after rebates.

Design
The hardware on the RIM BlackBerry Pearl 8130 hasn''t changed much from the original Pearl, but that''s not a bad thing, since we''re fans of the Pearl''s overall look. However, there are some slight tweaks, which we''ll note as we talk about the smartphone''s design.

Thankfully, the BlackBerry 8130 still keeps a slim profile, measuring a slight 4.2 inches long by 1.9 inches wide by 0.5 inch deep, and weighing 3.4 ounces. You''ll have no problem slipping this handset into your pants pocket, and it feels comfortable and natural to hold during phone calls. The silver chassis may seem ordinary to some, but we think it''s sleek and attractive. For the moment, Verizon Wireless will not offer the amethyst color, but it may decide to add it in the future.


The RIM BlackBerry Pearl 8130 retains the sleek design of its predecessor, and you''ll have no problems slipping it into a pants pocket.
Front and center, you have a 2.25-inch non-touch screen that displays 65,536 colors at a 260x240 pixel resolution. Text and images look sharp and vibrant, and the display features a light-sensing technology that will automatically adjust the backlighting, depending on your environment.

You can choose different font styles, as well as customize the home screen to your liking with various themes, background images, and menu styles. There''s also a small LED in the upper-right corner of the Pearl that illuminates various colors for different status alerts, such as new messages, low battery, and so forth.

Below the display, you''ll find the same navigation array and SureType keyboard of past BlackBerry Pearls. You get Talk and End keys, a shortcut to the main menu page, a back button and, of course, the pearl-like trackball navigator that started the whole Pearl revolution. All the controls are easy to use, and you can adjust the trackball''s vertical and horizontal sensitivity under Options > Screen/keyboard.


Not everyone will be a fan of the SureType keyboard, but it can be mastered with a bit of practice.
And then there''s the SureType keyboard. I''ve made it no secret that I''m not a fan of the modified keyboard. For those who are unfamiliar with SureType, there are two letters assigned to one key. As you start to enter the letters of a word, the SureType software will present you with a list of possible letter combinations or words, based on context.

Personally, I found it irritating, but I also know plenty of Pearl users who don''t mind it and have no complaints. As with anything new, it just takes some time to acclimate to, and it''s a trade-off for the smaller design. One other minor observation: the keyboard''s backlighting is a bit uneven and gives the buttons a cheap, plasticky look. It''s definitely not a deal breaker, but just something we couldn''t help but notice.

The most notable differences between the Pearl 8130 and the original GSM version are found on the side controls--all welcome additions. On the left spine, you''ll now find a 3.5mm headphone jack, so you can plug in decent headphones, and the microSD expansion slot has been relocated from behind the battery to the exterior of the phone for easy access.

There''s also a mini USB port and a customizable quick-launch button on the left, while there''s another convenience key and the volume rocker on the right. The top of the device has a Mute button, and the camera lens, the flash, and the self-portrait mirror are located on the back.


In addition to the 3.5mm headphone jack, we''re glad RIM moved the microSD expansion slot from behind the battery to the exterior of the phone.
Verizon Wireless packages the RIM BlackBerry Pearl 8130 with an AC adapter, a USB cable, a wired headset, a soft protective pouch, a BlackBerry Desktop software CD, and reference material. For more add-ons, please check our cell phone accessories, ringtones, and help page.

Features
The RIM BlackBerry Pearl 8130 is noteworthy for more than just the fact that it''s the first CDMA Pearl. It''s also the first device from RIM to offer video-recording capabilities and the first Pearl to have built-in GPS, not to mention the EV-DO support and improved Web browser. But first things first: Let''s discuss the phone capabilities.

Voice features on the BlackBerry Pearl 8130 include a speakerphone, voice dialing and commands, conference calling, text and multimedia messaging, and call-audio enhancement, which lets you boost the bass or treble. The address book is limited only by the available memory (64MB flash), and each entry can hold up to eight numbers, work and home addresses, e-mail and Web addresses, company information, and notes. For caller ID purposes, you can assign a photo to a contact as well as a group category--business or personal--or one of 45 polyphonic ringtones. The Pearl also supports MP3 and MIDI ringtones.

Unlike the 3G-deprived GSM Pearls, the Pearl 8130 works on Verizon''s EV-DO network, bringing data speeds of about 300Kbps to 600Kbps, though they could potentially hit 2.4Mbps. This means you should enjoy a faster Web-surfing experience, and it should also be more enjoyable, thanks to the improved browser.

Compared with Windows Mobile, Symbian, or Palm devices, the BlackBerry Web browser has always been kludgy and laborious for viewing sites; it requires a lot of scrolling up and down with the trackball or scroll wheel. However, now you get an onscreen cursor that you can move in any direction and place on any part of the page where you can click a link. In addition, there''s a Page View option that enables you to easily zoom in on part of a page. It''s definitely a huge improvement, and the boost of EV-DO speeds is heaven-sent. Disappointingly, the Pearl 8130 does not support any of Verizon''s V Cast services.

Other wireless options on the BlackBerry Pearl 8130 include Bluetooth 2.0 and GPS. You can use Bluetooth to connect to mono and stereo Bluetooth headsets, hands-free kits, and dial-up networking. To use the Pearl as a modem for your laptop, you will need to purchase a Broadband Access Plan from Verizon, which starts at $15 per month. It does not, however, support the object exchange profile.

The built-in GPS enables you to use the Pearl as a handheld navigation device. The device comes preloaded with the BlackBerry maps application that can provide text-based driving directions and search for local businesses. However, you can also get more robust programs, such as Google Maps for Mobile or Verizon''s VZ Navigator, which can provide real-time tracking, text- and voice-guided directions, points of interest, traffic data, and more. Be aware that the latter is an add-on service and costs $9.99 per month or $2.99 for 24-hour access.


The Pearl 8130 is equipped with a 2-megapixel camera, but the bigger news is that it can now record video.
The camera also gets an upgrade to a 2-megapixel lens (from 1.3 megapixels), but more importantly, you can now record video--a first for a BlackBerry. For still images, there''s a 5x zoom and flash, as well as three picture sizes and three quality options. You also get white-balance settings and several color effects you can add to the photo.

Video options are limited with just two video formats (normal or multimedia message), three color effects, and a video light. Picture quality was pretty good for a camera phone. Objects were sharply defined, but we wish there was a bit more brightness to the colors. Meanwhile, video quality was subpar, as our recorded clips looked dim and jerky.


Overall, picture quality was decent, although we wish for a bit more brightness.
Other than these new capabilities, the BlackBerry Pearl retains many of the same features that has made BlackBerrys popular, such as e-mail. The smartphone can sync with your company''s BlackBerry Enterprise server, with support for Microsoft Exchange, IBM Lotus Domino, or Novell GroupWise, to deliver corporate e-mail in real time. It also supports up to 10 personal/business POP3 or IMAP4 e-mail accounts. Instant messaging is limited to the proprietary BlackBerry Messenger client.

For mobile professionals, an attachment viewer opens popular file formats, such as Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Corel WordPerfect, PDF, JPEG, GIF, and more. You can also view tracked changes and embedded images and zoom, and rotate documents, but you can''t edit documents out of the box, though third-party software is available that allows this functionality.

The built-in media player remains pretty much the same. You can listen to MP3, WMA, AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, AMR-NB, and MIDI music files, and MPEG4, WMV, and H.263 video clips. For music, you can create playlists as "folders," and shuffle and repeat songs within a certain folder. It also displays song titles, the artist, and album art, if available.

In video mode, you get the option of full screen, replay, and repeat. Other applications on the Pearl include a calendar, a task list, a memo pad, an alarm clock, a password keeper, a calculator, a Brickbreaker game, and a voice recorder.

Performance
We tested the dual-band (CDMA 850/1900; EV-DO) RIM BlackBerry Pearl 8130 in San Francisco using Verizon Wireless service, and call quality was OK. On our end, we could hear a slight background hiss, but there was clear audio and plenty of volume. In other words, it wasn''t anything that prevented us from carrying on a conversation or interacting with our bank''s voice-automated system.

Meanwhile, our friends said we sounded fine, albeit a bit hollow. Activating the speakerphone didn''t diminish the call quality too much. Finally, we had no problems pairing the Pearl 8130 with the Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth headset, or the Motorola S9 Bluetooth Active Headphones.

Overall, the Pearl 8130 was a responsive device with minimal performance lags. We tried out the GPS capabilities with VZ Navigator, and it took about 3 minutes for the Pearl to get a fix on our location--pretty impressive for a cell phone.

Once locked on, it did a good job of tracking our position and offered accurate driving directions, though we think in-car use is a bit limited, given the smaller screen size. Multimedia performance was OK. There was a bit of hollowness to songs, and we craved more bass.

We are glad to see the inclusion of the 3.5mm jack, since plugging in some decent headphones improved the sound. We got the usual pixelation when watching video clips, but at least the audio and images synced up.

The BlackBerry Pearl 8130 is rated 3.6 hours of talk time and up to 9 days of standby time. We are still conducting our battery drain tests but will update this section as soon as we have final results. According to FCC radiation tests, the Pearl 8130 has a digital SAR rating of 1.48 watts per kilogram.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:45' WHERE "id" = 26[0m

Admittedly, there are some minor design flaws, but the pros outweigh the cons on this handset. Like the rest of the N series, multimedia is the star and the N79 stands out as an excellent camera phone, boasting high-quality images and advanced features. The Symbian smartphone also offers the full gamut of wireless options as well as a productivity suite and e-mail. It''s a device that can keep up with multimedia mavens and mobile professionals alike. While not cheap, the Nokia N79 is more affordable than some of the newer N series models (while offering many of the same features) and is one of our favorites from that family. The Nokia N79 is available unlocked through Nokia''s flagship stores and through online retailers for around $429.

Design
The Nokia N79 might have a simple candy-bar shape, but it''s quite a good-looking phone. The handset is nice and slim at 4.3 inches tall by 1.9 inches wide by 0.5 inch deep and 3.4 ounces, so it feels comfortable and light in the hand and will easily slip into a pants pocket. The attractiveness comes from the white face and chrome edges that gives the N79 a very modern and fresh look. The smartphone also ships with three interchangeable back plates (called XpressOn smart covers) in varying colors (white, red, and brown) so you can switch up the look of the phone depending on your style or mood. Even cooler, the phone''s theme will change with the cover. For example, the background color will match whatever smart cover you choose.


The Nokia N79 ships with three XpressOn smart covers that you can swap out depending on your style; each cover will also change the phone''s theme.
The N79''s QVGA display measures 2.4 inches diagonally and supports 16 million colors and a 320x240-pixel resolution. There''s a built-in accelerometer, but it''s not a touch screen so you''ll have to use the controls below the display to navigate the phone, which include two soft keys, Talk and End buttons, a Menu shortcut, a multimedia key, a back button, and a touch-sensitive navigation toggle with a center select key. Navigation wheel aside, we''re not huge fans of the controls, since they''re small and cramped. For example, the soft keys and Talk and End buttons are tiny slivers (similar to those on the Nokia N82) so they''re not very comfortable to press, and the menu and clear buttons are crammed in between them so they''re a little awkward to access.


We weren''t huge fans of the N79''s navigation controls and dialpad since they were a bit cramped.
The alphanumeric keypad offers a slightly better user experience, though not ideal, either. You get four rows of buttons but there''s no spacing between them to create individual keys. This didn''t pose a problem to us, however, since the numbers were far enough from each other. What is a bit troublesome is that the rows are pretty narrow so users with larger thumbs might find themselves hitting the number above or below the intended button. That said, we do prefer the N79''s styling over its predecessor, the Nokia N78.

Along the left spine, you''ll find a microSD expansion slot and a micro USB port--which are both protected by an attached cover--and the power connector. Meanwhile, the right side has a volume rocker, a camera activation/capture button, and dual speakers. On top of the unit, there''s a lock switch, a 3.5mm headphone/AV jack, and a power button. The camera and flash are located on the back, and the lens is protected by a sliding cover.

The Nokia N79 comes packaged with a wide variety of accessories, including the aforementioned back plates, a travel charger, a USB cable, a wired headset, a 4GB microSD card, video-out cables, a software CD, and reference material. For more add-ons, please check our cell phone accessories, ringtones, and help page.

Features
As with all Nokia N series models, the Nokia N79 is about multimedia and being able to access and share content right from your phone. The N79 doesn''t offer anything the other N series handsets don''t, but that''s not a bad thing since these smartphones are fully stocked and offer some advanced multimedia capabilities.

The built-in media player supports MP3, AAC, eACC, eACC+, and WMA files as well as podcasts. You can create playlists on the fly, and there''s support for album art, repeat, and shuffle modes. Audiophiles will appreciate the fact that there''s an equalizer to tweak sound, and we''re sure everyone will be pleased that the smartphone is equipped with a standard 3.5mm headphone jack and 3D stereo sound speakers. As we noted earlier, the N79 includes a wired headset, which isn''t very comfortable, but it features a built-in tuner so you can use the headphones to listen to FM radio.

There are several ways to get music onto your device. When you connect your N79 to your computer via USB cable, you can choose from several modes, including mass storage, media transfer, PC Suite, and image transfer. In most of those modes, it''s just a matter of drag-and-drop. There''s always the option to load music via microSD card as well. While the Nokia N79 is built to support the Nokia Music Store where you can browse and purchase tracks over the air, it hasn''t fully launched in the United States. We''ve been waiting for the U.S. store to open its virtual doors for a long time, and when asked about it at CES 2009, Nokia said it still has plans to do so but couldn''t give an exact date. Too bad, since we think it''d add much more value to the N series phones.

The N79 also plays MP4, 3GP, H.263, and H.264 video codecs and formats as well as video streaming. You can also record video using the 5-megapixel camera. Like the Nokia N96, the camera features a Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens and has a dual LED flash and up to 20x digital zoom. The zoom in video mode only goes up to 8x, which is still impressive, and you can record video at a maximum VGA resolution (640x480) at 30 frames per second. There are four additional quality settings, and the N79 can record video with sound in MP4 or 3GP (for multimedia messages) format. In addition, there''s a video stabilization feature to help reduce camera shake as you''re recording video, white balance, and color tone settings.


On back, you''ll find the N79''s 5-megapixel camera. The lens is protected by a sliding cover and you also get a dual LED flash.
We''re always impressed with the camera options on the Nokia N multimedia phones, and the N79 is no different. You can choose from eight shooting modes, ranging from close-up to sports to landscape, and five quality settings. You can adjust the brightness, contrast, white balance, color tone, ISO light sensitivity, and exposure value to get the best picture possible. The flash even has a red-eye reduction option. Plus, there''s also a self-timer and a sequence mode for multiple shots.


The N79 took some high-quality photos.
Picture quality was most impressive. The photos came out extra sharp with bright and vibrant colors, and there wasn''t any of that haziness that plagued the Nokia N78. Recorded videos also looked quite good, especially for a camera phone. Once you''re done snapping photos or video, you can send them via Bluetooth, multimedia message, or post them to the Web, whether it be to Nokia''s Ovi service or Flickr. The N79 features up to 50MB of internal memory and the microSD expansion slot can accept up to 8GB cards.

The N79''s voice features include world roaming, a speakerphone, speed dial, conference calling, voice commands, a vibrate mode, and text and multimedia messaging. The phone''s address book is only limited by the available memory, and the SIM card holds an additional 250 contacts. There''s room in each entry for multiple phone numbers, work and home addresses, e-mail addresses, a birthday, and more vitals. For caller ID purposes, you can assign each contact a photo, a ringtone, or a group ID. Bluetooth 2.0 is also onboard, with support for mono and stereo Bluetooth headsets, hands-free kits, dial-up networking, and file transfer.

The smartphone is also 3G-capable, supporting the 850/1900MHz HSDPA bands, meaning you''ll get the benefit of 3.5G speeds only if you use an AT&T SIM. (T-Mobile''s 3G network runs on the 1700/2100MHz bands.) Alternatively, the Nokia N79 has integrated Wi-Fi (802.11b/g) so you can also surf to the Web using a Wi-Fi connection.

For navigating the streets, the Nokia N79 has standalone and assisted GPS, so it uses both satellites and cellular triangulation to find your position. The smartphone also comes preloaded with the Nokia Maps application, which offers color maps, route planning, and points of interest. For real-time, turn-by-turn directions, you''ll have to upgrade the application, but Nokia is now offering a complimentary three-month trial of the turn-by-turn service. Afterwards, you''ll have several purchase options, including a one-year license for $125.77 or a one-month license for $13.96.

Finally, the N79 runs the third edition of the S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 2 on the Symbian operating system for your productivity needs. An app called QuickOffice lets you view Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents, and it optimizes the pages for the phone''s screen, so you don''t have to scroll all over the place to read text. There are some nice shortcuts to jump to the top or bottom of the page to reduce the up-and-down scrolling, and there''s also a search function. However, if you want any editing capabilities, you''ll have to upgrade the preloaded copy of QuickOffice. For messaging, the device can access IMAP4, POP3, and SMTP e-mail accounts and comes with a full attachment viewer. It also supports a number of push e-mail solutions, as well as Microsoft Exchange Server synchronization, but this is dependent upon your service provider and company''s e-mail solution, so check with your IT department if you have any questions.

There are a number of other productivity tools on the phone, including a ZIP manager, a measurement converter, a PDF reader, a calendar, a clock, a calculator, and a message reader. There is a shortcut to the N-Gage gaming platform from where you can download and interact with other gamers; but like the Nokia Music Store, it''s not fully operational yet in the States.

Performance
We tested the quad-band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900; WCDMA 850/1900) in San Francisco using AT&T service and call quality was mixed. We made numerous calls to friends, and most of the time, we enjoyed clear sound with just some slight background hiss and volume was nice and loud, even at lower levels. However, there were a couple of instances where calls sounded fuzzy--enough be distracting, though our friends reported no major complaints. We were able to use an airline''s voice-automated system with no problems and we didn''t experience any dropped calls during our testing period. The speakerphone wasn''t anything to write home about, since calls sounded spotty at times. We were able to pair the N79 with the Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth headset and the Motorola S9 Bluetooth Active Headphones.

The Nokia N79 proved to be a good little performer, keeping up with our demands. The screen''s accelerometer was very sensitive and quick to change orientation whenever we rotated the phone. There was minimal to no delay when launching or using applications, even the multimedia features, which can sometimes trip up other smartphones. Speaking of multimedia, music playback through the phone''s speakers was quite good. We could have used a smidge more bass, but all things considered, the N79 produced admirable sound with plenty of volume. Thanks to the 3.5mm headphone jack, we were able to plug in our Bose On-Ear Headphones and enjoyed even better sound quality. Video playback was smooth with matching audio and picture.

The Nokia N79 has a 1,200mAh lithium-ion battery with a rated talk time of 5.5 hours (3.5 hours on 3G) and up to 15.5 days of standby time (16.5 days on 3G). In our battery drain tests, the N79 provided 8.5 hours of continuous talk time on a single charge. According to FCC radiation tests, the N79 has a digital SAR rating of 1.4 watts per kilogram.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:45' WHERE "id" = 29[0m

There''s a lot of pressure on this little smartphone; HTC executive Cheng Hui-ming has called it "the most important product for HTC this year," and of course, the Touch Diamond has been compared to the Apple iPhone. Now, we''re still a few months out from seeing the U.S. version of the Windows Mobile 6.1 smartphone, but we couldn''t wait. Thanks to Dynamism, we were able to get our hands on an unlocked version of the Europe/Asia HTC Touch Diamond to try out. Now, to be clear up front, since this isn''t optimized for use here in the States, we''re not going to knock it for the lack of U.S. 3G support or the fact that''s it tri-band. However, we will ding it for its sluggish performance and subpar call quality. It was really quite disappointing, especially since we think it''s an incredibly sexy device and the new 3D interface is so cool. As is, we wouldn''t really recommend shelling out the $700 for an unlocked version, but hopefully, some of these issues will be resolved once the HTC Touch Diamond is released in the United States.

Design
You may have seen pictures of the HTC Touch Diamond and thought it looked beautiful, but the images simply don''t do it justice. The smartphone is that much more stunning in person with its sleek mirrored face and the prism effect on the back. It''s also smaller than we originally thought at just 4 inches tall by 2 inches wide by 0.4 inch deep and 3.8 ounces, so you certainly won''t have any problems slipping this compact handset into a pants pocket. The overall shape of the Touch Diamond reminded us of a smaller Microsoft Zune.


You''ll largely use the HTC Touch Diamond''s TouchFLO 3D interface to operate the phone, but there are some tactile buttons below the screen.
The smartphone is outfitted with a gorgeous 2.8-inch, 680x480 pixel resolution touch screen. With the VGA quality, text and images looked amazingly crisp and vibrant. Plus, the Touch Diamond is equipped with an orientation sensor, so it will automatically switch the orientation of the screen whether you''re holding it vertically or horizontally. While this is all well and good, we think it may be the new TouchFLO 3D interface that really catches your eye. It builds on the TouchFLO interface that was first introduced on the HTC Touch, but the look and feel is completely different. The Home Screen now just displays a larger clock and your call history and calendar, but along the bottom of the screen, you''ll notice a toolbar where you can move left to right to launch other applications, including e-mail, music, the Web, a customizable weather page, and the settings menu. In several of the programs, more specifically e-mail, the camera, and music, you can go through your files and messages by swiping your thumb/finger up or down the screen, all with a cool animated, 3D effect.

In all, the TouchFLO 3D interface is very cool, and we think it certainly goes a long way toward making the smartphone more attractive to consumers with its less businesslike look. However, it''s not the most intuitive and has a bit of a learning curve. More specifically, it''s not always clear which finger swipe actions work in which applications. As for text entry, you can use the onscreen keyboard, which you can switch from full QWERTY to compact QWERTY to phone keyboard or other format, depending on your preference. Most of the time, we used the full QWERTY mode and though it looked fairly cramped, we found it pretty easy to use and didn''t have too many mispresses. On the other hand, when you have the keyboard open, it takes up about half of the screen, so if you''re entering text into any field on the bottom half of the screen, it''s covered up. It''s actually quite annoying.

Below the display, you get some tactile controls. There''s a Home key, a back button, Talk and End keys, and a directional keypad with a center select button. With the exception of the select key, which has a slight concave shape, all the buttons are flush with the phone''s surface, and they''re fairly easy to press. And while it''s not apparent at first, you can press the navigation keypad up, down, left, and right, In addition, it''s also touch sensitive, so in certain applications (multimedia album, camera, Opera Mobile, and Word and Excel Mobile) you can use your thumb or finger to make a clockwise or counterclockwise circle to zoom in/out of pages.

On the left spine, you will find a volume rocker, while the stylus and USB port/headphone jack are located on the bottom of the unit. We''re disappointed that the Touch Diamond didn''t come with a 3.5mm headphone jack; heck, we''d even settle for a 2.5mm headset jack, but instead you''re pretty much limited to using the uncomfortable earbuds that are included in the box, unless you get a headset adapter. There''s a power button on top, and the camera is located on the back.


Just like the smartphone itself, the packaging for the HTC Touch Diamond is sexy.
The HTC Touch Diamond comes packaged in a very sleek box with the following accessories: a travel charger, a USB cable, an extra stylus, a wired stereo headset, a software CD, and reference material. For more add-ons, please check our cell phone accessories, ringtones, and help page.

Features
Behind all the flash and pretty looks, the HTC Touch Diamond is at its core still a Windows Mobile smartphone. It runs the latest Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional Edition. Since the Touch Diamond uses the TouchFLO 3D interface, you don''t get the new Getting Started menu on the Home screen to set up e-mail, Bluetooth, and the like. It''s still there but you''ll have to go under the Windows menu to access it. Here, you''ll also find your standard productivity tools, including a PDF reader, a task manager, a voice recorder, a Zip manager, and a calculator. Of course, you also get the Microsoft Office Mobile Suite for editing and creating Word and Excel documents and viewing PowerPoint presentations. As for memory, the Touch Diamond has 256MB ROM and 192MB DDR SDRAM and 4GB of internal storage. While we appreciate the large storage capacity, we''re disappointed that there are no expansion capabilities, so keep an eye on this, especially if you like to store a lot of pictures and music on your smartphone.

Like other Windows Mobile devices, the Touch Diamond offers Microsoft''s Direct Push Technology for real-time e-mail delivery and automatic synchronization with your Outlook calendar, tasks, and contacts via Exchange Server. You can also access your POP3 and IMAP accounts, and HTML e-mails are supported. Using the Getting Started utility, we configured our review unit to access our Yahoo account and also synchronized our phone with our PC via Microsoft ActiveSync 4.5. Both processes went off without a hitch.

Phone features on the HTC Touch Diamond include a speakerphone, voice dialing and commands, and text and multimedia messaging. The address book is only limited by the available memory (the SIM card holds an additional 250 contacts) and you can store up to 12 numbers for a single entry, as well as home and work addresses, e-mail, IM screen name, birthday, spouse''s name, and more. For caller ID purposes, you can pair a contact with a photo, a caller group, or one of 40 polyphonic ringtones. The smartphone also has Bluetooth 2.0 that supports mono and stereo Bluetooth headsets, hands-free kits, file sharing, dial-up networking, and more.

As we noted earlier, we reviewed the Europe/Asia version of the smartphone, so it''s tri-band (GSM 900/1800/1900) rather than quad-band. As such, AT&T coverage will be spotty in some places, and no surprise, it doesn''t support our U.S. 3G bands. Surfing the Web on EDGE speeds isn''t our idea of fun but fortunately, the Touch Diamond is also equipped with Wi-Fi. We should note that the device also ships with the Opera Web browser, in addition to the standard Internet Explorer Mobile. The smartphone offers Adobe Flash Lite 2, but not the latest Flash Lite 2, which offers FLV support (read: YouTube videos). To make up for this oversight, there is a preloaded YouTube app on the Touch Diamond that allows you to watch said videos. The final wireless radio on the Touch Diamond is GPS for real-time tracking and turn-by-turn directions (with the addition of a location-based service or navigation software). With the assisted GPS, the handheld can also use cellular towers and nearby Wi-Fi hot spots to more quickly find your location.


On back of the Touch Diamond, you''ll find the 3.2 megapixel camera, which is nicely incorporated into the prism design.
The HTC Touch Diamond is equipped with a 3.2-megapixel camera with up to 4x zoom and videorecording capabilities. There are six capture modes (photo, video, panorama, MMS video, contacts picture, and picture theme). For still photos, you have a choice of five resolutions and four quality settings in addition to white balance and brightness controls. Other tools at your disposal include a photo counter, a self timer, flicker adjustment, and various effects. In video mode, you get four resolutions as well as white balance, brightness, and effects.


We were slightly disappointed by the picture quality, as colors looked washed out. There''s also a bit of shutter lag.
Picture quality was OK. For the most part, objects had clear definition, but there was a bit of shutter lag, so we found you had to have a really steady hand (and patience) to get a clear shot. Also, colors weren''t very bright or rich. Recorded video clips looked decent, but again, there was some delay between the time we pressed the capture button to the time the camera actually started/stopped recording.

You can also enjoy your personal library of music and video with Windows Media Player 10 Mobile. As always, there''s support for AAC, MP3, WAV, WMA, MPEG-4, WMV files, and more. Plus, you can check out shows recorded on your Windows Media Center PC or stream your home''s TV programming right to your device with a Slingbox and SlingPlayer Mobile. The HTC Touch Diamond also throws in a couple of multimedia extras, including an FM radio, which you must use with the included headset, an audio booster, a streaming media app, and a utility called MP3 Trimmer that allows you to cut and trim MP3 files and make them into ringtones.

Performance
We tested the tri-band (GSM 900/1800/1900; GPRS/EDGE) HTC Touch Diamond in San Francisco using AT&T service, and call quality was subpar. On our end, there was a bit of a background hiss, but not so bad that we couldn''t hear our callers. Volume was good and voices sounded clear; we also didn''t have any problems using an airline''s voice-automated response system. Unfortunately, our callers had nothing good to report. One friend said we sounded "horrible," as our voice was drowned out by a crackling noise, and activating the speakerphone didn''t improve matters, as it only added an echo to the mix. With the Getting Started menu, the Touch Diamond automatically found and connected to both the Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth headset and the Motorola S9 Bluetooth Active Headphones.

Despite being powered by a 528MHz Qualcomm processor, the HTC Touch Diamond felt very sluggish. There was often a lag when just switching between menus and launching applications, and there were a couple of occasions where the delay was long enough to make us think the system froze. In all, we found using the Touch Diamond was a frustrating experience because of the slow performance. Browsing the Web on GPRS/EDGE speeds was painfully slow, so we obviously used a Wi-Fi connection when possible. Multimedia performance was mixed. Music playback through the phone''s speakers sounded weak and tinny. Watching video clips was tolerable in short spurts, and audio and images were always synchronized.

The HTC Touch Diamond''s 900mAh lithium ion battery has a rated talk time of 5.5 hours and up to 11.8 days of standby time.

  [4;36;1mBackground Update (0.7ms)[0m   [0;1mUPDATE "backgrounds" SET "data" = 'The LG Versa from Verizon Wireless is a touch-screen phone with a difference. Promising to be the most versatile phone we''ve ever seen (hence the "Versa" moniker), it comes with the option of adding external modules to increase its functionality. Out of the box, for example, the Versa comes with an attachable QWERTY keyboard, but if you prefer not to have the extra bulk, just detach it and you can still type with the virtual keyboard on the touch screen. LG plans to have additional modules in the future, such as external speakers and a game pad controller.

Even without the modules, the Versa is a very good touch-screen phone by itself. It has an animated interface, where you can customize up to three home screens. The Versa has a full HTML browser with support for Flash Lite, so you can watch your favorite YouTube clips on the go. Other features include a 2.0-megapixel camera, access to V Cast Video and V Cast Music, EV-DO, GPS, stereo Bluetooth, and more. Though the browsing experience was less than satisfactory and we''re not pleased with the lack of Wi-Fi, we''re quite impressed with the Versa and with the promise of future modules. The LG Versa is available now for $199.99 with a two-year service agreement and a $50 rebate.

Design
By itself, the LG Versa looks almost exactly like the LG Dare. Measuring 4.17 inches long by 2.07 inches wide by 0.54 inch thick, the Versa is slim and sleek, plus the back battery cover has a nice soft touch surface. Like the Dare, it has a large 3-inch-wide touch-screen display on its front face, plus the Call, Clear/Voice command, and End/Power keys. We liked the screen size for the most part, but it does make surfing the full HTML browser less than enjoyable (more on that in the Features section). The Versa is around 3.81 ounces, which won''t weigh you down.


The LG Versa looks like the LG Dare.
The display supports 262,000 colors and 480x240 pixel resolution, which result in vibrant graphics with plenty of detail. You can adjust the backlight time, the menu fonts, the dial fonts, the display theme, the banner, the wallpaper, and even the image of the charging screen (Literally, this is the image that''s on the screen while the phone is charging). Instead of just one home screen, you can have up to three (or up to four if you attach a module). You have one home screen for all your application shortcuts, one screen with media shortcuts and Web bookmarks, and another with contact shortcuts (also called Favorites). Do note, however, that you''re only limited to these three home screens; you can''t create your own home screen that''s a mix of different kinds of shortcuts. And as previously mentioned, you get a dedicated screen when using the keyboard module. In order to switch home screens, just swipe at the display and the screen will rotate like a 3D cube. Each home screen has shortcuts to the message in-box, the phone dialer, the main menu, and the phonebook along the bottom row.

Customizing each home screen is pretty easy. There''s a gear icon on the right of each home screen; tap that, and you''ll be brought to a settings page for that particular home screen. For the Favorites home screen, you can choose a contact from your phonebook; for the Media home screen, you select from the Pictures, Videos, Music, or Bookmarks folder; and for Shortcuts, you pick from the entire list of applications. To remove shortcuts, just select the ones you don''t want and then tap the Trash icon. You can have different wallpaper for each home screen as well. The keyboard module home screen is the only one you can''t customize. It shows shortcuts to the browser, e-mail, a new text message, the calendar, mobile instant messaging, and the notepad.

The Versa''s touch screen provides tactile feedback. There''s a calibration wizard for adjusting the screen''s sensitivity to your liking, and you can alter the vibrate type (short, double, or long), the vibrate level (low, medium, high, or off), and the accompanying sound effect. You can choose from four sound effects, plus a silent option.

The touch interface was pretty responsive on the whole, but we still had problems in certain applications. For example, in the browser we had to tap at the menu 8 or 10 times before it would pop up. This is perplexing, since the touch screen is much more responsive when navigating the interface and when dialing and texting.

Speaking of dialing, the phone dialer interface consists of the standard numeric keypad plus a speakerphone button, a voice command button, a Clear button, and links to the recent calls list and the contacts list. When you''re done dialing, you can hit either the green Call button, the physical Talk button, or bring up a menu of additional options (like adding a 2-second pause, or to start a new text message). You can also hit the Save button for saving a new number to the phonebook.


The LG Versa comes with a detachable QWERTY keyboard module.
The Versa has a built-in accelerometer that will rotate the display 90 degrees in either direction when the phone is held horizontally. This works with all applications and menu interfaces except for the home screens; for that, you''ll need the keyboard module.

If you''re a frequent texter with a need for a QWERTY keyboard, you''re in luck. The Versa comes with a bonus QWERTY keyboard module right in the box. Just remove the battery cover and align the keyboard contact pins with those along the right side of the phone. We didn''t like that you had to remove the battery cover in order to add the module.

Clad on all sides in faux leather, the keyboard attachment looks like it belongs in an executive''s attache case. We''re OK with the design, but it might not appeal to some people. The module acts like a case, and has cutouts for the camera on the back. On the front is an external monochrome 0.94-inch OLED display with date, time, signal and battery strength, plus caller ID information. There are also two call buttons underneath that. The Versa is about an inch thicker with the module attached and is about half an ounce heavier.


The LG Versa''s QWERTY keyboard module has an external OLED display.
When the keyboard module is attached to the Versa, not only will you have access to the aforementioned keyboard module home screen, but the display''s orientation switches to landscape mode automatically when you''re holding the phone horizontally. The keyboard itself is a pleasure to use with a roomy design and tactile keys. There''s a dedicated alias (@) key that doubles as a .com key, a dedicated speakerphone key, and arrow keys for navigation. There are number keys along the top of the keyboard, and a button for typing symbols. To remove the module, just slide the lock mechanism on the left side of the Versa.

If you decide not to use the keyboard module, the Versa has several other ways of entering text via the touch screen. You can use either the virtual T9 keypad, handwriting recognition, or the virtual QWERTY keyboard. In order to use the keyboard, just rotate your phone 90 degrees in the counterclockwise direction and the QWERTY keyboard will appear. Tapping each key will magnify that key momentarily. There are dedicated alias (@), .com, comma, and period keys, plus arrow keys for navigation and a Shift key for capital letters. You can also switch to a numbers and symbols keyboard by hitting the abc/123 key. You can copy and paste text, but you won''t get an autocorrect feature. At the end of the day, however, the physical keyboard is much easier to use than the virtual keyboards.

The handwriting recognition works like the graffiti method--just write as you normally would and it will convert your scribbling into text. Yet, it''s not smart enough to identify numbers from letters, and uppercase letters from lowercase---we had to keep switching between the different modes instead. We recommend using the included stylus as writing with our finger resulted in a lot of mistakes.

The dedicated camera key, volume rocker, headset jack, and charger jack are on the left spine, while the microSD card slot is on the right. On top of the Versa is the screen lock key. We''re a little disappointed the Versa has a 2.5mm headset jack instead of the standard 3.5mm headset jack. The camera lens and LED flash are on the back. The stylus is clad in faux leather, and you can attach it to the Versa like a cell phone charm.

Features
The Versa comes with a generous 1,000-contact phone book with room in each entry for five numbers and two e-mail addresses. You can categorize callers to groups and pair them with a photo and one of 22 polyphonic ringtones for caller ID. Other basics include text and multimedia messaging, a vibrate mode, a speakerphone, a calculator, a tip calculator, a calendar, an alarm clock, a stopwatch, a world clock, and a notepad. There''s also a drawing pad, which lets you sketch little drawings with a variety of pen colors and sizes. You can send the image via a multimedia message if you wish.

More advanced features include mobile e-mail, mobile instant messaging (AOL, Yahoo, and Windows Live), voice command and voice dialing, voice recording, USB mass storage mode, an RSS reader, and GPS functionality via Verizon''s VZ Navigator. Mobile e-mail can only be accessed via the browser interface, and is limited to certain Web mail services like Windows Live, Yahoo, AOL Mail, AIM Mail, Verizon.net and a few others, but certainly not Exchange, so the Versa can''t quite compete with a smart phone.

The Versa also comes with Visual Voicemail, which lets you pick and choose which voice mail message to listen to, plus you can delete, reply to, and forward each message. You can even reply with a voice message of your own if the other person is also a Verizon Wireless customer. You can view information like date and time of receipt, message duration, and more, in order to prioritize your response. Verizon lets you store up to 40 messages for 40 days. Unfortunately, Verizon charges a $2.99 monthly fee for this, which we think is too much since AT&T and Sprint charge nothing for their respective services.

You also get full Bluetooth support, with stereo Bluetooth, file transfer, and the ability to use the phone as a modem. Bear in mind that you will need the $59.99 a month Mobile Broadband Connect plan to tether the Versa to your laptop.

The Versa has a full HTML browser and is one of a few mobile browsers to support Flash Lite 3 and the H.264 video standard. We were able to watch videos right from the Versa''s browser, but not all formats will work. It won''t support longer higher-quality Flash videos like those on CNET TV, but for quick clips from YouTube, it works great. You''re also able to have up to three browser windows, or tabs, open at a time. You can view Web pages in full-screen view or a normal view, with the controls visible. Other browser settings include the ability to access the browser history, send a URL via text or e-mail, search the text on a Web page, set the keypress and connection timer, and toggle Flash and JavaScript on and off.

Aside from the Flash experience, the browsing experience was disappointing. As we said earlier, the touch-screen''s response is pretty terrible on the whole. For example, we had to tap at the menu icon several times before it would appear. This seems to be a browser-only problem, since we had no such issues with the QWERTY keyboard and the menu interface. Also, while the browser would load WAP pages just fine, it crashed on full HTML pages on more than one occasion, prompting us to hard reset the phone by taking out the battery. Because the Versa has a relatively small screen compared with the Apple iPhone, there was also a lot more scrolling involved when navigating large Web pages. In short, the Versa''s browser left us less than satisfied. On the upside, we like that you can use the volume rocker plus the onscreen controls to zoom in and out of Web pages, and we could smoothly pan and scroll through them too.

As a phone on a 3G EV-DO network, the Versa supports Verizon''s broadband services like V Cast Video, Verizon''s streaming video service, and V Cast Music with Rhapsody, Verizon''s music download service. The Versa''s music player is a lot like the one on the Dare; it''s not housed within the V Cast interface and is easy to use and navigate. There are shortcut icons to Play All (the full playlist), Shop (the V Cast Music store), and Sync (USB syncing), and the player automatically organizes the songs by genre, artist, and album. Settings include repeat and shuffle, plus you can create and edit your own playlists. You can play the song in the background while you''re navigating other parts of the phone, plus music player controls appear on the home screen so you can control your songs and change tracks without opening the music player. The player interface itself is quite simple, with the typical play/pause and track controls plus album art if you buy the song from the Verizon V Cast store.

Each song in the V Cast Music store costs $1.99, and it includes a download to the PC as well. You can purchase a song directly from V Cast to your PC for only 99 cents, and if you have a Rhapsody music subscription, you can load your subscribed tracks to your phone. The Versa supports up to 16GB microSD cards, so you can have additional storage for your MP3s.


The LG Versa has a 2.0-megapixel camera with a LED flash
We''ll admit that we expected more than a 2-megapixel camera with the Versa, since the Dare had a 3.2-megapixel camera. That said, photo quality was good for the most part; images look sharp and colors are vibrant. You can take photos in five resolutions (1,600x1,200, 1,280x960, 800x400, 640x480, and 320x240), five white balance presets, and five color effects. Other settings include autofocus, spot/average photometry, three shutter sounds (with a silent option), a self-timer, flash, and a panorama mode. There is also something called SmartPic technology, which helps to enhance images with face color compensation and light compensation in low-light situations. The latter is especially useful since the LED flash isn''t that great. Another nice feature is face detection, to ensure your subject''s face is in focus.


The LG Versa took good photos.
After taking a picture, you can edit it with the built-in image editor. You can zoom in, rotate, crop, change the contrast, sharpen, and blur your photos. There''s a drawing tool so you can doodle over your images, plus you can add fun frames and stamps. The built-in camcorder can record up to three resolutions (176x144, 320x240, and 640x240 VGA)--the VGA format is only for storing on the device, since MMS can''t support files that large yet. You can record videos up to 470KB for MMS. Settings are similar to that of the still camera.

Personalization options are plenty with the Versa. You can customize it with wallpaper, graphics, sounds, and more. You can download more options via the Web browser. The Versa does not come with any games.

Performance
We tested the LG Versa in San Francisco using Verizon Wireless''s network. Call quality was good overall. Callers could hear us loudly and we could hear them, with very little static in the background. Our voices sounded rather harsh though, and not at all natural. Speakerphone quality was also not great, with a rather hollow and tinny sound. Callers could still hear us just fine though. The audio quality of the speakers is the same with the music player, with a rather weak bass. We would opt for a stereo headset for better sound quality. The LG Versa is compatible with M4 and T4 hearing aids.

We were impressed with the EV-DO Rev. A speeds. Web pages loaded in seconds, and it took about a minute to download a 1MB song. Streaming video quality was surprisingly good as well, especially the ones from YouTube. There was little buffering time, if any. The video itself was rather blurry and pixelated, but that''s to be expected.

The LG Versa has a rated battery life of 4.83 hours of talk time and 17.9 days of standby time. Our tests revealed a talk time of 5 hours and 20 minutes. According to the FCC, the LG Versa has a digital SAR rating of 1.38 watts per kilogram.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:45' WHERE "id" = 35[0m

  [4;36;1mBackground Update (0.6ms)[0m   [0;1mUPDATE "backgrounds" SET "data" = 'Messaging phones were big news at CTIA 2009 and AT&T''s Samsung Impression, aka the Samsung SGH-A877, quickly emerged as one of the most talked-about handsets at the show. With a brilliant display, a solid multimedia feature set, and a spacious keyboard, it offers just about everything you''d want from a messaging handset. And even though we didn''t test the call quality at CTIA, which turned out to pretty good, we did name it as our best phone of the show. We had a couple of complaints, but on the whole it''s one of the best AT&T phones we''ve seen in a while. The Impression is $399 if you pay full price or $199 with service and a mail-in rebate.

Design
From the outside, the Samsung Impression resembles the LG Xenon. It has a similar shape and the keyboard feels about the same. We were glad it wasn''t another recycled design of the Samsung Rant. But when compared with the Xenon, the Impression makes a better go at it. The display is larger and more vibrant and the controls are more comfortable. It''s also a bit bigger (4.48 inches long by 2.28 inches wide by 0.61 inch deep) and heavier (5.3 ounces), but the Impression has a sturdy, ergonomic feel in the hand. The dark blue color scheme almost looks black, and we like the curved edges; together they give the phone an eye-catching appeal.

The Impression''s touch screen is undoubtedly the highlight. As an active-matrix organic light-emitting diode display, it is a sight to behold with its brilliant colors, bright graphics, and sharp animations. At 3.25 inches, it''s just over the minimum size that we require from a touch-screen phone, but it offers plenty of room for most functions. The display is responsive and we welcome the tactile feedback. You can change the calibration and the intensity of the feedback.

On the bottom of the display are three touch controls for the phone dialer, the contacts menu, and the main menu. The interface for the phone dialer features large numbers and a shortcut for the contacts menu. You can also use the standard 10-button keypad to tap out text messages, but we''re not sure why you''d want to.

The icon-based menu interface is intuitive and easy to use; we had no issues finding what we wanted in the submenus. And thanks to the "power search" feature, you can thumb through a long list of contacts using the first letter of each entry. Other display options you can adjust include the brightness, font type, and the backlight time.

The Impression offers Samsung''s TouchWiz interface, which we''ve seen on several of the company''s phones over the past few months. As we''ve said before, Touch Wiz has its good points and its bad points. Though we like the collapsible navigation bar and its shortcut widgets, we wish it offered more customization. Sure, you can move the widgets around at will, but you can''t create new widgets beyond the ones that come on the phone.

Below the display are three physical controls: the Talk, End/power, and Clear keys. Though they''re flat with the surface of the phone, they remain spacious and tactile. Other exterior controls consist of a display-locking key and a camera shutter on the right spine, and a volume rocker and a shortcut control on the right spine. Pressing the latter will open onscreen shortcuts for the phone dialer, the messaging menu, the Web browser, the music player, and the games menu.

On the top of the phone is the combination headset jack/charger port. Though it''s conveniently located, the jack is proprietary so you can only use your own headset with an adapter (not good). Also, you can use only one peripheral at a time. The camera lens and speaker are on the back side of the phone and the memory card slot rests behind the battery cover. Fortunately, you don''t need to remove the battery to access it.


We like the Impression''s roomy keyboard. When the display is open, the TouchWiz applications have a landscape orientation.
Slide the display to the right to expose the physical keyboard. At 4 inches across, the keyboard is one of the most spacious we''ve ever seen on a cell phone. What''s more, even though the keys are flush, they remain tactile and easy to press and find. We were off and texting pretty quickly and we made few mistakes. Our only complaints were that the space bar is a tad small and that shortcut controls are few. Besides a dedicated key for the messaging application, you''ll just shift and function keys and arrow navigation controls for scrolling through menus. Numbers and symbols are surfaced directly on the keyboard, though they share buttons with letters. The keyboard is brightly backlit for texting in the dark and it offers plenty of space on either side.

If you don''t want to use the physical keyboard, the Impression also offers a virtual onscreen keyboard and a handwriting recognition tool. Both are fine for occasional use, but we prefer the physical keyboard for heavy texting situations. You can use the T9 predictive texting application in the virtual keyboard, which is helpful since it''s almost too small to use two hands.

Opening the keyboard will change the display''s orientation in standby mode or when you''re in the main menu. The wallpaper doesn''t flip, which is slightly disconcerting, but the widgets on the TouchWiz bar change their orientation. Also, we like that you can view the menu in landscape mode. The Impression''s accelerometer works in certain applications only. By rotating the phone, you can switch between the virtual keypad and keyboard and you can flip the orientation of the photo gallery and Web browser.

Features
The Impression offers a solid set of midrange multimedia features, but we''ll start with the basics first. The phone book holds a hefty 2,000 contracts, with room in each entry for four phone numbers, an e-mail address, a URL, a company name and job title, a birthday, a nickname, a street address, and notes. You can save callers to groups and pair them with a photo, a message, and one of 11 (72-chord) polyphonic ringtones. You can save an additional 250 names to the SIM card.

Basic features include a vibrate mode, an alarm clock, a calendar, a task list, a memo pad, a calculator, a world clock, a timer, a currency and unit converter, a speakerphone and a stopwatch. You''ll also find a voice recorder, stereo Bluetooth, PC syncing, USB mass storage, a file manager, and GPS with support for AT&T Navigator. Voice dialing is a disappointing omission.

As expected, the Impression is a messaging machine, supporting text and multimedia messaging and instant messaging. Yet, the handset falls a bit short when it comes to e-mail. While AT&T Mobile E-mail does offers access to AOL, AIM, Yahoo, Hotmail, and Bell South accounts, it''s a clunky Web-based application. We much prefer a dedicated e-mail that would sit directly on the handset (as on the iPhone or the Samsung Instinct) with true syncing. We''re also disappointed that the Impression can''t access IMAP4 accounts.


The camera lacks a flash, which is disappointing for a 3-megapixel shooter.
The 3-megapixel camera takes pictures in five resolutions, from three megapixels down to 400x220. Other editing options include four quality settings, five "scene" selections (like night and landscape), exposure metering, four color effects, adjustable brightness and white balance tools, a self-timer, 20 fun frames, a multishot mode, a smile shot feature (the camera snaps a picture when it detects a smile), and a mosaic shot mode. The camera interface is easy to use with many options surfaced on the viewfinder.

The camcorder shoots clips in two resolutions (320x240 and 176x144), while offering a similar set of editing options. Clips meant for multimedia messages are capped at about one minute, but you can shoot for much longer in normal mode. The Impression has 190MB of user-accessible shared memory, but you can use a memory card for more space.


The Impression has great photo quality.
Photo quality was pretty good, with bright colors and little image noise. We also had enough light despite the phone''s lack of a flash. We should note, however, that vanity shots will be tricky with a self-portrait mirror. Videos are fine, but not exceptional--definitely not beyond normal camera phone quality. The photo gallery application is a mixed bag: we liked that you can cycle between different photos by swiping your finger across the display or by tipping the phone to either side, but we didn''t like that you don''t always get an MMS option when viewing individual photos.

As a 3G (UMTS) phone, the Impression offers the full set of AT&T''s wireless broadband multimedia services. You''ll find Cellular Video (streaming-video content) and AT&T Mobile Music (wireless song downloads through partners). The experience with the two applications is similar to that on other AT&T phones; both are minimalist in their designs, but the music player supports a wide variety of file formats (MP3, AAC, eAAC+, and WMA) and it offers useful features, such as album art, playlists, shuffle and repeat modes, and an airplane mode.

The Impression also has a solid selection of music-related features, such as support for XM Radio Mobile, a Music ID application, a Billboard Mobile channel, music videos, and a community section with access to fan sites and downloads. We especially welcome the application that lets you create your own ringtones and saving music tracks as ringtones.

The full HTML browser isn''t quite like the iPhone''s Safari browser, but it exceeded our expectations. Scrolling around Web pages was pretty smooth, thanks to the responsive touch screen. We didn''t experience the usual jerky motion when dragging our finger across the display. As mentioned earlier, the display''s orientation will rotate automatically when using the Web browser, but it''s rather annoying that your bookmarks list works only in portrait mode. That means that you must rotate the phone back and forth. The magnifying glass tool isn''t our favorite method for zooming in on Web pages--we prefer Apple''s pinching motion--but it works well enough.

You can personalize the Impression with a variety of wallpapers, sounds, and a greeting message. You can buy more options and additional ringtones from AT&T with the Web browser. You also get a number of subscription-based applications, including Mobile Baking, Yellowpages Mobile, MobiTV, MobiDJ, The Weather Channel, and Where 2.1. For gaming, the Impression comes with demo versions of five titles: Ms. Pac-man, Diner Dash 2, JuiceCaster, Midnight Pool2, and Monopoly. The quirkiest application is Tumbling Dice, which will come in handy if you forget real dice.

Performance
We tested the quad-band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) Samsung Impression world phone in San Francisco using AT&T service. Call quality was quite good under almost all conditions. The audio was clear and free of static and we encountered no interference from other electronic devices. Voices sounded natural and we had enough volume to hear in even noisy environments. Our only issue was an occasional background noise, but it was a satisfactory experience on the whole.

On their end, callers said we sounded great. A few couldn''t even tell that we were using a cell phone. Some had a bit of trouble hearing us if we were in a noisy place, but that''s not uncommon for any cell phone. We also had few issues when speaking to automated-calling systems.

Speakerphone calls were fine for the most part. The volume was very loud and we could stray a bit from the phone and still be heard on the other end. Voice quality was a bit distorted on our side, but not enough to be worrisome.

The Impression is compatible with 850 and 1900 UMTS 3G bands. We''d like support for 3.5G HSDPA bands, as well, but we can let it pass. On the whole, the phone performed well in data tests. The Web browser was pretty zippy and downloads took just a few seconds.

Cellular Video quality was quite good. Videos kicked in relatively quickly and the quality was free of heavy pixelation. The sound was also in sync and quick movements looked pretty good. We also were pleased that the frame size used the entire display. Too often that''s not the case. We had to pause once to buffer, but videos didn''t freeze.

Sound quality over the external speaker was fine, but not nothing spectacular. The audio lacked warmth and most tunes sounded tinny. Headphones will provide the best experience.

The Impression has a rated battery life of just three hours talk time, which is rather low for a GSM phone. The promised standby time is 10.4 days. However, our tests showed a talk time of 7 hours and 53 minutes on a single charge. According to FCC radiation tests, the Impression has a digital SAR rating of 0.27 watts per kilogram.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:45' WHERE "id" = 37[0m

If we wanted to play around with higher-performance camera phones, we had to get our hands on unlocked versions like the 8-megapixel Samsung Innov8 from our friends in Europe.

But that has all changed with the 8-megapixel Samsung Memoir, which is now available from T-Mobile USA for a much more affordable $249.99 (compared to the $700 or so for the Innov8). Indeed, this makes the Memoir the highest-performing camera phone with a U.S. carrier, though we''re sure this accolade won''t last long. The Memoir definitely delivers in the photo quality department, with great photos and camera features that rival even those on a standalone point-and-shoot camera. The Memoir even offers direct uploads to online photo-sharing sites like Flickr and Photobucket.

Of course, the Memoir wouldn''t be much of a phone if it didn''t have other features, too. It comes with Samsung''s proprietary TouchWiz interface, a full HTML browser, support for T-Mobile''s 3G network, GPS, a music player, and more. $249.99 is a little pricier than most other U.S. camera phones, but we think the Memoir''s design and feature set more than make up for it.

Design
The design of the Samsung Memoir certainly walks a very thin line between camera and phone. The ergonomics are uncanny--the shutter button and zoom controls are on the top, the camera lens and flash are positioned in a way so that your fingers are unlikely to block them, and the touch-screen interface acts as a giant viewfinder--all like a regular camera. That small area where you would wrap your right-hand fingers when taking a photo? It''s clad in faux leather separate from the rest of the phone, presumably for better grip. If it were not for the telltale call keys and the T-Mobile branding, we would''ve thought the Samsung Memoir was a camera and not a phone.


Is it a camera or a phone? The Samsung Memoir mimics a camera very well.
Be it camera or phone (or both), the Memoir is one svelte, elegant device. Measuring 4.2 inches long by 2.1 inches wide by 0.6 inch thick, the Memoir is clad in black with silver on the sides, and it''s one of the slimmest high-end camera phones we''ve seen. Dominating its entire front surface is a 262,000-color 2.6-inch touch-screen display that looks simply stunning. The display is vibrant with vivid colors and sharp-looking graphics. You can adjust the backlight time and brightness, and you can personalize the display with wallpaper and a greeting message. While you can adjust the font type, you can''t change the font size.

Like other Samsung touch-screen handsets, the Memoir has haptic feedback, meaning the phone vibrates to let you know your touch has registered. You can adjust the intensity of the vibrations if you want. The touch interface is pretty responsive and intuitive, but it did take us a little while to get used to the sensitivity of the screen, even after calibration. We would occasionally launch a program when all we wanted to do was scroll through the menu. We imagine this is something you learn to adapt to with time, but newcomers to touch-screen handsets might find it frustrating. Also, the Memoir has an internal accelerometer that automatically changes the display''s orientation from portrait to landscape mode when you hold the phone horizontally. This only happens with certain applications like the Web browser and the messaging interface, and it only rotates clockwise by 90 degrees.

On the default standby page, you''ll find four icons at the bottom row of the display. They represent the phone dialer, the phone book, the Web browser, and the main menu. The phone dialer has a virtual keypad with large alphanumeric keys, plus there are also shortcuts for the call log, voice mail, the messaging menu, and the phone book.

The Memoir features Samsung''s proprietary TouchWiz interface, just like on the Behold and the Omnia. It consists of a tray of widgets along the left side, which lead to various applications like the clock, the music player, and so forth. You can also drag and drop them to the main screen for easier access to your favorite applications. But some of these widgets are more than just shortcuts. For example, the Weather widget will display the city you''re in as well as your local weather report right on the main screen, and the music player widget allows you to control your music without having to open up the application.

You''re unfortunately limited to the widgets that are preloaded to the Memoir, but Samsung did include a camera-focused widget. It allows you to upload your photos to online sharing sites like Flickr and Photobucket directly, without having to use e-mail or a third-party program. This is definitely one of the highlights of the phone, which we''ll mention again in the Features section. Aside from dragging and dropping the widgets to the main screen, you can also drag them back to the tray. To close the tray, just touch the little arrow icon.


The Samsung Memoir has a virtual QWERTY keyboard in landscape mode.
For texters concerned about the lack of a physical keyboard, the Memoir does have a virtual QWERTY keyboard. After you create a new message, you can tilt the phone horizontally to reveal the landscape QWERTY keyboard that spans the length of the display. The keyboard is roomy and the haptic feedback helps to ensure accurate typing, but it''s not quite as smooth as using the iPhone''s virtual keyboard. We like that you can type messages with the T9 alphanumeric keypad if you wanted to, and the dedicated punctuation keys are nice (You still have to switch to a different keyboard for symbols and numbers). When in the Web browser, the QWERTY keyboard even has a .com key, which is certainly helpful when entering URLs.

There are three physical keys underneath the display; the Talk, Back, and End/Power keys respectively. The microSD card slot and headset/charger jack are on the left spine. On the right are the camera shutter button, a screen lock key, and the volume rocker that also acts as the camera''s zoom controls. On the back is the aforementioned 8-megapixel-camera lens with a built-in retractable lens cover. There''s also a Xenon flash, but no self-portrait mirror.

Features
The Samsung Memoir''s camera is the primary reason to get this handset, despite the fact the Memoir comes with a whole host of other advanced features. We''ll get to that shortly, but first we wanted to let you know a few essentials before we delve into the main course. The Memoir has a large 2,000-entry phone book with room in each entry for four phone numbers, four instant-messaging usernames, a Web site address, birthday and anniversary dates, a street address, and notes. You can save callers to groups, pair them with a photo for caller ID, plus one of 23 polyphonic ringtones.

Other essentials include a vibrate mode, a speakerphone, text and multimedia messaging, a calendar, a calculator, a notepad, a task list, an alarm clock, a world clock, a timer, a stopwatch, and a currency and unit converter. It also has voice command, PC syncing, Web-based e-mail for a variety of providers (AOL, Yahoo, GMail, Comcast, etc.), instant messaging, GPS support, and stereo Bluetooth. The Memoir is also one of the few phones to support T-Mobile''s 3G network. News junkies will also like the built-in RSS reader. Though there''s 3G, there is no Wi-Fi, which is quite a disappointment seeing as there''s a full HTML browser and photo upload capabilities.

The Samsung Memoir''s camera is similar to the Innov8 in terms of features. The 8-megapixel camera can take pictures in up to seven resolutions, from a large 3,264x2,448 to the smallest 320x240. Some of the more typical camera settings include color effects, white balance presets, 8x digital zoom, a self-timer, three quality settings, a mosaic-shot mode, three shutter sounds with silent option, and nine fun frames. You will even find more advanced camera settings like an adjustable ISO and exposure metering.

You also get 12 preset scene settings for certain conditions like portrait, landscape, sports, indoor, beach, sunset, backlight, and more. If you''ve ever had problems with jerky photos, you''ll like the Memoir''s antishake mode. Smile-shot helps you to snap a photo only when the people are smiling, and blink detection lets you know when someone has blinked. We''ve tried both smile and blink detections, and it worked flawlessly. For business travelers, you''ll like the ability to use the camera for capturing business cards, so you might never have to carry a bunch of business cards home with you again. There''s even a panorama mode that lets you auto-stitch photos after shooting seven photos in quick succession from left to right (or vice versa).

The camcorder is impressive as well. The Memoir can record clips in two resolutions (640x480 and 320x240) in one of three modes: normal mode, picture message mode, and slow-motion video mode. Videos in normal mode are kept for however much storage is on the phone. Picture messages are capped to 30 seconds, and slow-motion video capture is shot at 120 frames per second. The settings are similar to the still camera.


The Samsung Memoir takes really great photos.
Photo quality is simply amazing. We''re very impressed by the sharp images, accurate colors, and little to no image noise. After you''re done shooting photos, you can store them in the phone or up to a 8GB microSD card. You can also e-mail them, send them to a friend, plus you can upload your photo directly to one of four online sharing sites--Flickr, Kodak Gallery, Photobucket, and Snapfish. You just log into your preferred site, and upload directly from the phone--no need for a special e-mail address or a third-party application like Shozu. We really like this feature, since you do not need to resize your photo down to a more Web-friendly resolution and can instead upload the full original photo if you like. The Memoir also supports geotagging if you want your photos to be tagged with the location where you took the photo.

The Memoir has a pretty simple music player. It supports album art, you can create and edit playlists, there are shuffle and repeat modes, plus six equalizer settings. You load music onto it with a USB cable by dragging and dropping into it. You can set the player to play in the background while multitasking.

Thankfully, the Memoir also offers a full HTML browser. It is similar to other Samsung browsers--you can scroll through pages by dragging your finger across the page. You can use the camera''s physical zoom controls to zoom in and out of Web pages, which is very nice. And as we said above, the virtual QWERTY keyboard on the browser has a dedicated .com button, which helps in entering URLs. You can save bookmarks easily, and you can get rid of the surrounding controls for full screen mode if you want. It''s not quite as good as the iPhone''s browser of course, but it compares favorably with other proprietary Web browsers.

You can customize the Memoir with wallpaper, alert tones, and more. If you want more options, you can download them from T-Mobile''s t-zones store. There are no included games.

Performance
We tested the quad-band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) Samsung Memoir in San Francisco using T-Mobile. We were impressed with the call quality. Callers sounded loud and clear, with natural voices, and nary a sign of static. On their end, callers said we sounded fine as well, though they did complain of the occasional background noise. Speakerphone calls performed admirably as well. Callers could still hear an echo, but it wasn''t that bad. We could certainly hear them loud and clear, though with a slightly tinnier voice quality.

Music quality was pretty good. The external speakers give out a rather hollow sound with not a lot of bass, but the overall sound is fine. We would recommend using a headset for better audio quality of course.

The Memoir supports T-Mobile''s 3G network (UMTS 1700/2100). It is very fast. We connected to Web pages in seconds and were able to upload a 2.2MB photo in just under a couple minutes.

The Samsung Memoir has a battery life of 5.5 hours talk time and 12.5 days standby time. It has a tested talk time of 5 hours and 5 minutes. According to FCC radiation tests, the Memoir has a digital SAR rating of 0.618 watt per kilogram.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:45' WHERE "id" = 39[0m

However, it looks as if Verizon Wireless is making some people''s holiday wishes come true as the carrier has picked up the Samsung Omnia (SCH-i910) and will start offering it through business sales channels and online on November 26 and in stores on December 8.

Verizon''s Omnia offers a lot of the same great features as the unlocked GSM version of the phone, including a large touch screen with Samsung''s customizable TouchWiz user interface, a 5-megapixel camera, integrated Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS. In addition, it adds support for the carrier''s EV-DO Rev. A network, which allows for faster Web browsing and downloads. Like the RIM BlackBerry Storm, the Omnia is not the best smartphone for those who need a messaging-centric device, since the onscreen keyboard is a bit cramped. However, for Verizon Wireless customers looking for a touch-screen smartphone, you''ll get a better user experience and faster performance from the Samsung Omnia than the BlackBerry Storm. While slightly pricier at $249.99 (with a two-year contract and after rebates and discounts), the Omnia is worth the extra $50 and is a respectable competitor to the Apple iPhone.

Design
The highlight of the Samsung Omnia is its touch screen and TouchWiz user interface. It''s hard to ignore the 3.2-inch TFT screen that dominates the face of the smartphone, and with a 262,000-color output and 240x400-pixel resolution, the display is quite eye-catching. Admittedly, it''s not as sharp as some of the other touch-screen devices out there, such as the HTC Touch Diamond or the BlackBerry Storm, but it''s still bright and clear for viewing images and text.


The Samsung Omnia is sleeker and faster than the RIM BlackBerry Storm.
For text entry, you have several options, including a full QWERTY keyboard (called Samsung Keyboard), Block Recognizer, Transcriber, and more. The full QWERTY is fairly cramped in portrait mode, so you might want to switch to the keypad or use the included stylus for more accuracy. Even the full QWERTY keyboard in landscape mode isn''t the most spacious, but we managed to get by OK. Obviously, it''s not going to be the best device for messaging fanatics, but we were still able to compose short e-mails and text messages with fewer errors than the BlackBerry Storm even though the latter had larger buttons. The Omnia does provide haptic feedback, so you''ll feel a slight vibration to confirm your action. You can adjust the intensity of the vibration in the Settings menu.

There is a built-in accelerometer so the screen orientation will rotate from portrait to landscape mode when you turn the phone left or right. We like that you get vibrating feedback when you rotate the phone to let you know it''s registered the change. It''s also one of the most responsive accelerometer-equipped smartphones we''ve tested. The screen orientation on the Samsung Omnia was always quick to change whenever we flipped the handset, unlike the Storm and the HTC Touch Pro.

What makes the Omnia unique, however, is Samsung''s TouchWiz user interface. TouchWiz lets you customize your Home screen with different "widgets." There is a tray located on the left side with various applications, such as the clock, music player, photo gallery, games, and notepad. You can then drag and drop these widgets to the main screen so they''re easily accessible to you every time you fire up your phone. Once you''ve customized the phone to your liking, you can collapse and hide the tray by tapping the arrow button. Beyond the Home screen, there''s also the Main Menu page that organizes the major applications in a nice easy-to-use view--very non-Windows Mobile.

One of the complaints we had about the unlocked Omnia is that you were limited to the widgets that were preloaded on the smartphone. The same is true with the Verizon Omnia, but Samsung and Verizon have at least added a couple more shortcuts for your use, most notably an Internet browser widget. In all, you get 16 widgets to choose from, including messages, wireless manager, contacts, calendar, games, and multimedia. Admittedly, the look doesn''t offer the cleanest-looking layout, and if you find you''re not a fan of TouchWiz interface or if you''re a traditionalist, you can switch back to the standard Windows Today screen or choose from other themes in the Settings > Today menu.

Physically, the rest of the Verizon Samsung Omnia doesn''t differ much from the unlocked GSM version. For more information on the smartphone''s design, please read our full review of the unlocked Samsung Omnia.

Verizon Wireless packages the Samsung Omnia with an AC adapter, a stylus, a USB cable, a 3.5mm/FM radio antenna, a 2.5mm headset adapter, software CDs, and reference material. For more add-ons, please check our cell phone accessories, ringtones, and help page.

Features
The Verizon Samsung Omnia offers many of the same core functions of the unlocked model, though there are some differences and new additions. Starting with the phone features, the CDMA Omnia includes a speakerphone, conference calling, speed dial, voice dialing and commands, and text and multimedia messaging. The smartphone also supports visual voice mail. The address book is limited only by the available memory, and each contact can hold multiple numbers, addresses, birthdays, notes, and more. For caller ID purposes, you can pair an entry with a picture, a group ID, or one of 22 polyphonic ringtones.

Bluetooth 2.0 is onboard for use with mono and stereo Bluetooth headsets as well as hands-free kits, object push for vCard, basic imaging, phonebook access profiles, and dial-up networking. If you want to take advantage of the DUN capabilities and use the Omnia as a wireless modem for your laptop, be aware that you will need to sign up for one of Verizon''s BroadbandAccess plans, which start at $15 per month.

The Verizon Samsung Omnia work on the carrier''s EV-DO Rev. A network so you should enjoy faster Web browsing, e-mail, and downloads. The Rev. A offers an extra boost over regular EV-DO, bringing download speeds up to the 450Kbps-to-800Kbps range versus 400Kbps-to-700Kbps, while upload speeds will average around 300Kpbs to 400Kpbs (compared with EV-DO''s 50Kpbs to 70Kbps). Of course, this is all dependent if you live in a coverage area (you can find a coverage map from Verizon''s Web site).

In addition to the 3G capabilities, lo and behold, you also get integrated Wi-Fi. We always like having another option for connecting to the Web, especially if you''re out of network coverage and it''s also faster, so we''re glad to see the wireless option on the Omnia. For Web browsing, you can use Internet Explorer Mobile but the Samsung Omnia also ships with the Opera Mobile Web browser. With Opera, you can open numerous tabs, zoom in pages by double-tapping the touch screen, bookmark sites, and much more.

The Omnia offers integrated GPS/A-GPS for navigation capabilities. To get a fix on your location, the smartphone will use both satellites and cellular triangulation but for real-time turn-by-turn directions, traffic data, and more, you will need to subscribe to Verizon''s VZ Navigator location-based service, which costs $9.99 per month or $2.99 per day. Unfortunately, VZ Navigator was not activated on your review unit, so we weren''t able to truly test the GPS capabilities.

The Omnia runs Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional Edition with all the usual trimmings, including the Microsoft Office Mobile Suite and support for Microsoft''s Direct Push Technology for real-time message delivery and automatic synchronization with your Outlook calendar, tasks, and contacts via Exchange Server. The Omnia can also be configured to access your POP3 and IMAP e-mail accounts. There are plenty of other PIM tools to keep you on task and organized, including a task list, a task manager and switcher, a smart converter, a calculator, and a PDF reader, among other things. You can also download more programs, games, and utilities from the Verizon AppZone. Some sample titles include Spb Backup, Agenda One, iSS Mine Sweeper, PhatPad, and more.

For fun, the Omnia offers several multimedia features. In addition to the standard Windows Media Player 10 Mobile, Samsung includes something called the Touch Player, which features a nicer user interface and functionality similar to, but not as streamlined, as the iPhone''s Cover Flow. Supported music and video formats include MP3, WMA, AAC, eAAC+, MP4, 3GPP, H.264, DivX, and Xvid. Other goodies include podcast support, a streaming media player, and an FM radio, though you have to use the included headset for the latter. While the unlocked version of the Omnia was offered in 16GB and 8GB capacities, Verizon will only offer the 8GB model. Still, that''s a lot of memory and you have the microSD/SDHC slot for expansion capabilities (accepts up to 16GB cards).


The Samsung Omnia features a 5-megapixel camera with flash and other advanced features.
The Omnia comes equipped with a 5-megapixel camera with a slew of advanced features. In addition to video recording and digital zoom, you get a flash, auto focus, panorama mode, antishake, face detection, and SmileShot (can detect when someone is smiling and automatically take a picture) just to name a few. For still images, there are three quality settings and six size options. You have a grand total of 15 shooting modes, ranging from sports to sunset to fireworks as well as white balance adjustment, various effects, ISO settings, and much more. You can even geotag your photos with the embedded GPS radio. In video mode, you don''t get as many tools, but you still get three size and three quality choices.


The Omnia''s camera took high-quality photos.
Picture quality was excellent. The antishake feature really made a difference in getting clear shots as we tried taking photos both ways, and got blurry images when the function was turned off. Colors looked good, and video quality was also pretty good, with just some slight pixelation. Once done, you can, of course, send your photos via e-mail or multimedia message. The Omnia also has a Digital Frame application that displays the time and date, while rotating through your photo gallery in the background. Finally, you get TV-out capabilities, and a video-editing application is included on the device in case you want to make a quick movie on the spot.

Performance
We tested the dual-band (CDMA 850/1900; EV-DO Rev. A) Samsung Omnia in San Francisco using Verizon Wireless service and call quality was good. There was minimal background distraction and voices sounded rich and clear on our end, and we had no problems using an airline''s voice-automated response system. On the other end, callers said we sounded mostly clear with just some slight echoing. When we activated the speakerphone, call quality diminished slightly. Voices sounded somewhat robotic and we also had problems finding the perfect volume. To hear our friends, we had to turn the volume up to the second highest level, but then audio sounded blown out. However, if we moved it down one notch, it was too soft. We successfully paired the Omnia with the Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth headset and the Motorola S9 Bluetooth Active Headphones.

On more than one occasion, we saw the little Windows pinwheel spin round and round as we waited for the Samsung Omnia to launch an application. The lag in performance was usually just a matter of a few seconds, but it was noticeable. That said, the device was definitely more responsive than the BlackBerry Storm and the system didn''t freeze or crash during our test period. There is also a Task Manager in the Settings menu to help manage your running applications and optimize your smartphone''s performance.

Using Verizon''s EV-DO Rev. A network, it took the Omnia about 25 seconds to fully load CNET.com in the Opera Web browser while the mobile sites for CNN and ESPN came up in about 10 to 15 seconds. Our review unit also had no problem detecting and connecting to our Wi-Fi network. Music playback sounded a bit hollow through the phone''s speakers, and unfortunately, the Omnia features a proprietary jack and not a 3.5mm headphone jack. The good news is that there''s an audio adapter included in the box, so you can still plug in a nice pair of earbuds or headphones. Video playback was smooth with decent quality.

The Samsung Omnia has a rated talk time of 5.7 hours and up to 19 days of standby time. In our battery drain tests, we were able to get 8 hours on continuous talk time on a single charge.

The RIM BlackBerry Storm brewed up a lot of hype and excitement as the first touch-screen BlackBerry. The touch capabilities were news enough alone but add to that Research in Motion''s SurePress functionality (the technology that makes the screen clickable), an impressive feature list, and the competitive $199.99 pricing, and there were a lot of expectations for the BlackBerry Storm to succeed. However, when the Storm finally blew into town, it was a definite letdown because of the phone''s sluggish performance and bugginess.

Verizon Wireless has since released a firmware update that improves some of the issues but not completely. The Storm is a faster, better device after the upgrade, including the responsiveness of the accelerometer, and improved battery life. However, the phone still has various bugs and just doesn''t feel quite like final product. There may be subsequent updates that resolve all the problems, but we would have preferred RIM and Verizon waited a while longer to make sure the BlackBerry Storm was stable and solid before releasing the device, even if it meant missing the holiday rush.

Prizefight: BlackBerry Storm vs. iPhone 3G 
Design
In terms of form factor, the RIM BlackBerry Storm doesn''t stray far from the other full touch-screen smartphones on the market today, including the Samsung Omnia and Apple iPhone. Sporting a black casing with silver accents, the handset is a bit blocky and heavy at 4.4 inches tall by 2.4 inches wide by 0.5 inch deep and weighs 5.6 ounces, so it feels a bit wide when you hold it in your hand and it''ll make for a tight fit in a pants pocket. That said, the Storm is a well-constructed smartphone. It has a nice, solid feel and the edges have a soft-touch finish to provide a better grip.

The RIM BlackBerry Storm is a bit shorter and heavier than the Apple iPhone.
While the Storm''s design might not be the most inspiring, the smartphone''s display is another story. Obviously, the fact that the Storm is the first touch-screen BlackBerry is news enough, but its 3.25-inch VGA glass display also demands attention for its sharpness and brightness, showing 65,000 colors at a crisp 480x360-pixel resolution. We weren''t as impressed with the Storm''s screen as the BlackBerry Bold, but it''s still beautiful. You can also adjust the backlighting, font size, and type. The Storm is also equipped with an accelerometer, so the screen orientation will switch from portrait to landscape mode when you rotate the phone from a vertical position to a horizontal one, left or right.

Moving onto the touch-screen capabilities, the BlackBerry Storm uses SurePress, so that when you select an application or enter text, you actually push the screen down like you would any other tactile button. You can see a bit of a gap at the top and bottom of the screen, which but makes the phone. In terms of text extry, the BlackBerry Storm features a SureType keyboard when the smartphone is in portrait mode and then switches to a full QWERTY keyboard in landscape mode (See Performance section for more information). When using the keyboard or selecting applications, you do a simple finger touch over the item until it''s highlighted and then you press down on the screen to register the action.


The Storm''s SurePress touch screen and onscreen keyboard takes some acclimation.
In addition to the SurePress technology, you can also use a number of finger taps or swipes to perform certain actions. For example, you can tap on the screen twice to zoom in on a Web page or map, or do quick finger swipes to scroll though a page. Also, to copy/paste text, you just touch the screen at the start of the text and then with a second finger, touch the end of the block of text you want to copy. You can adjust the tap interval, hover point, and swipe sensitivity in the Options > Screen/Keyboard menu.

While the SurePress technology is cool, it definitely takes some acclimation. It''s not a natural feeling to physically push down on the screen, and we often found ourselves forgetting to actually press down; instead just tapping or double tapping on the letter button or link. You do get used to it after a while though, but as far as e-mail creation or text messages, we missed having a tactile keyboard. We couldn''t comfortably type long messages as fast as we wanted and when we tried, the message was riddled with errors. The keyboard buttons are just a bit too small and cramped. If I had problems with my small hands, I can only imagine it would be worse for users with larger thumbs.


You get some standard controls below the display, but we missed having the trackball navigator.
Below the display, you do get a set of tactile navigation controls that consists of Talk and End/Power buttons, a Menu key, and a clear button. Unlike other BlackBerry models, there is no trackball navigator and we have to admit that we missed it. It may be that we''re just used to having the trackball, and often we found our thumb automatically looking for the control while trying to scroll through pages and menus. However, even beyond that, we think it wouldn''t hurt to have a trackball navigator since it allows for easier one-handed operation. Also, you wouldn''t always have to rely on the touch screen and it would be useful for certain operations like for selecting links on a Web page.

On the left side, there''s a user-programmable shortcut key and a micro USB port, while the right spine has a 3.5mm headphone jack, a volume rocker, and another customizable button, which is set as the camera activation/capture key by default. The camera lens and flash are located on the backside, and behind the battery cover, you''ll find the microSD/SDHC card holder and SIM card slot. Finally, though not readily apparent, there is a device lock and mute button on the top edge of the Storm.


Behind the battery cover, you''ll find the Storm''s SIM card and microSD expansion slot.
Verizon Wireless packages the RIM BlackBerry Strom with healthy set of accessories, including a travel charger with various adapters, a USB cable, an 8GB microSD card, a SIM card, a wired headset, a software CD, and reference material. For more add-ons, please check our cell phone accessories, ringtones, and help page.

Features
While the RIM BlackBerry Storm might be the first touch screen for Research in Motion, the company wanted to make sure the smartphone offered the same feel and functionality of previous and current BlackBerrys. The Storm runs the latest BlackBerry OS 4.7, bringing an updated user interface much like the BlackBerry Bold and the BlackBerry Pearl Flip. You now get DataViz Documents To Go Standard Edition, so you can now edit Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files as well. If you want the capability to create new documents, you will have to upgrade to the Premium Edition. We had no problems opening and working on Word and Excel documents, but we can''t imagine doing more than minor edits on the Bold or any other smartphone for that matter. Other PIM applications include a Calendar, a task list, a memo pad, a voice recorder, a calculator, a password keeper, and more.

The BlackBerry Storm also has the new BlackBerry Application Center where you can download more programs and utilities to your device. The full store is anticipated to launch in Sprint 2009 (though developers can submit their applications in December for approval), but there are eight applications currently available, including Facebook, Flickr, and various instant messaging clients.

For e-mail, the Storm can sync with your company''s BlackBerry Enterprise server, with support for Microsoft Exchange, IBM Lotus Domino, or Novell GroupWise, to deliver corporate e-mail in real time. You can also access up to 10 personal/business POP3 or IMAP4 e-mail accounts via the BlackBerry Internet Service. Like all recent BlackBerry models, the Storm has a spell-check feature that will look for errors in e-mails and memos, but not text messages. There''s also an attachment viewer for opening Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Corel WordPerfect, PDF, JPEG, GIF, and more.

As a phone, the BlackBerry Storm offers dual-mode functionality, so the phone switches automatically between CDMA and GSM networks to offer seamless international roaming--all while keeping the same phone number. (Note that the phone does not support domestic GSM bands.) In all, you get voice coverage in 157 countries (22 of those on CDMA) and e-mail coverage in 62 countries. Just be aware that you''ll still incur roaming rates, which range from $0.69 to $2.49 a minute. Verizon also offers technical support if you need help while overseas. First, there''s a 24-hour Global Help Desk that''s open seven days a week. In addition, you get a calling card for free support calls while traveling outside of the United States from any landline phone to technical support your BlackBerry Storm is lost, broken, or stolen.

The address book is only limited by the available memory with room in each entry multiple phone numbers, e-mail addresses, work and home address, job title, and more. For caller ID purposes, you can assign a photo, group category, or one of 32 polyphonic ringtones. Other voice features include a speakerphone, voice-activated dialing, smart dialing, conference calling, speed dial, and text and multimedia messaging. You can also download Visual Voice mail from the BlackBerry Application Center. Bluetooth 2.0 is onboard with support for a mono and stereo Bluetooth headsets, serial port profile, phone book access, and dial-up networking. To use the Storm as a wireless modem for your laptop, you will need a subscription to one of Verizon''s BroadbandAccess plans, which start at $15 per month.

The BlackBerry Storm runs on Verizon''s EV-DO Rev. A network, which allows for faster Web browsing, e-mail, and downloads. The Rev. A offers an extra boost over regular EV-DO, bringing download speeds up to the 450Kbps-to-800Kbps range versus 400Kbps-to-700Kbps, while upload speeds will average around 300Kpbs to 400Kpbs (compared with EV-DO''s 50Kpbs to 70Kbps). Of course, this is all dependent if you live in a coverage area (you can find a coverage map from Verizon''s Web site. The smartphone also offers support for the 2,100MHz UMTS/HSDPA, so you can get 3G support while overseas. Unfortunately, there''s no integrated Wi-Fi, which we find disappointing. We realize and understand the argument that the 3G radios does away with the need for Wi-Fi, but we still like having that option, especially if you drop out of range or don''t live in a coverage area.

The BlackBerry Storm has a full HTML Web browser that you can view in Internet Explorer or Firefox mode, depending on your preference. You can check out sites in page view or column view, and navigate via pan mode or cursor mode. In pan mode, you can move around pages simply by dragging your finger and then double-tapping the screen to zoom in. To select a hyperlink, you just highlight the link and then click. Meanwhile, in cursor mode, you can just place the cursor over the link and click or use the onscreen magnifying glass to zoom in. There''s also a collapsible toolbar along the bottom that lets you go to new sites, change views, and more. There is support for streaming media, including YouTube''s mobile site. As we''ve said before, the BlackBerry browser has greatly improved over the years, but it''s still not as easy to use as the iPhone and its multitouch screen.

Last but not least of the wireless radios is integrated GPS. You can use the BlackBerry Storm as a handheld navigator, but to get real-time turn-by-turn directions, traffic data, and more , you will need to subscribe to Verizon''s VZ Navigator location-based service, which costs $9.99 per month or $2.99 per day.


The BlackBerry Storm features a 3.2-megapixel camera with video recording and auto focus.
Moving onto multimedia features, the BlackBerry Storm is equipped with a 3.2-megapixel camera with video recording capabilities, as well a flash, auto focus, 2x zoom, and image stabilization. In camera mode, you get a choice of three picture sizes and three picture qualities. There are white balance settings, and you can add various effects to your photos, such as black and white, and sepia. With the built-in GPS, you can also geotag photos. As usual, options are more limited in camcorder mode as you only get a choice of two video formats (normal and MMS) and three color effects. The volume rocker can be used to zoom in and out in both camera and video mode.


We were pretty disappointed by the picture quality, as colors looked flat and gray.
Picture quality was subpar. While we could identify objects in the picture, they looked a bit soft and the colors were completely washed out. Video quality, on the other hand, was pretty impressive with good light and better image quality than other smartphones we''ve tested.

The Storm''s built-in media player can play various music and video formats, including MP3, WMA, AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, AMR-NB, and MIDI music files, and MPEG4, WMV, DivX4, XviD (partial support), and H.263 video clips. There''s a search function, playlist creation, shuffle and repeat, and you get a full-screen mode for video playback. The included software CD also contains a copy of Roxio Easy Media Creator, so you can create MP3s from CDs and add audio tags. Like the latest BlackBerrys, the Storm also works with the BlackBerry Media Sync application so you can load your iTunes library. There''s 1GB of onboard memory and 128MB of flash memory onboard, while the microSD/SDHC expansion slot can accept up to 16GB cards. Unfortunately, for now, it looks like the BlackBerry Storm will not support Verizon''s V Cast music and video services.

Performance
We tested the RIM BlackBerry Storm in San Francisco using Verizon Wireless service, and call quality was quite good. We enjoyed clear audio with no noticeable background noise or voice distortion, and we didn''t experience any dropped calls during our test period. There were also no problems using an airline''s voice automated response system. On the other end, our friends reported similarly positive results and said they had no problems hearing us. Unfortunately, the speakerphone didn''t fare as well. Both sides experienced choppy call quality as words occasionally were cut off. There was also some slight voice distortion on our end. Overall, we were able to carry on full conversations and volume was not a problem, but we definitely had to ask our callers to repeat themselves on more than one occasion. Finally, we successfully paired the Storm with the Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth headset and the Motorola S9 Bluetooth Active Headphones.

The firmware update definitely improved performance, but there are still multiple issues. We downloaded the software upgrade using the desktop manager, and the entire process went smoothly with no problems. The biggest improvement we noticed was the improvement in the accelerometer. The Storm was much faster to change the screen orientation when we rotated the phone. However, page redraws are still on the slow side and there''s continued bugginess. For example, while checking out a Web page, we turned the phone to check it out in landscape mode and the screen went on the fritz for a couple of seconds and went completely blank, though eventually the site came back up. Also, when we were listening to music, we changed orientation and the player controls started to flicker. Launching and using multimedia applications like the camera and multimedia player were definitely better, however, with faster response times and the problems with the inconsistent camera toolbar looks to be resolved.

Music playback through the phone''s speakers sounded blown out, though there was plenty of volume. Thankfully, the built-in 3.5mm headphone jack so should allow you to enjoy better sound quality. Video performance wasn''t quite as dazzling as the BlackBerry Bold''s. There was a bit more pixilation, but we still enjoyed smooth playback. Web browsing was pleasantly swift thanks to Verizon''s EV-DO Rev. A network. It took about 25 seconds to 30 seconds for graphics-intensive sites such as CNET to fully load, while the mobile sites for CNN and ESPN loaded in about 10 seconds.

The Storm''s GPS capabilities were great. It took the smartphone only about two minutes to get a fix on our location, and we used VZ Navigator to plot a course from the Marina District of San Francisco to CNET''s downtown headquarters. Route creation was quick and it was able to get us back on course in a timely matter after we purposely missed several turns. That said, the voice-guided directions sounded blown out at the medium-high level and too soft at the medium level, so that was a bit of a struggle.

The BlackBerry Storm comes with a 1,400mAh lithium ion battery with a rated talk time of 5.5 hours and up to 15 days of standby time. In our battery drain tests, the Storm offered 7 hours of continuous talk time on a single charge. The battery performance in day-to-day usage was better. Before the firmware update, the battery would already be at 50 percent after just a couple hours of using the phone, Web, and multimedia applications, but after the update, it would only be drained about 25 percent. One thing we noticed, however, after a period of use the phone gets a bit warm where the battery is located on the back.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:45' WHERE "id" = 44[0m

In recent weeks, we''ve seen the release of a number of highly anticipated smartphones, including the RIM BlackBerry Bold and the T-Mobile G1, and now we have the Sony Ericsson Xperia X1. First announced at GSMA 2008 in February, the Xperia X1 made headlines for being the company''s first Windows Mobile device and for its interactive panel interface. It was such a showstopper that we barely got a look at the smartphone because of the swarms of spectators.

Fast-forward to now, where the Sony Ericsson Xperia X1 is finally ready for release and we''ve had a chance to spend some time with the final product. The X1 panel interface is undoubtedly cool, and we like having that extra level of personalization. It''s also a well-crafted handset with a strong set of features and good performance. However, we have big doubts about its success. Unfortunately, the Xperia X1 will not be offered by a U.S. carrier at this time, but you will be able to buy it unlocked from Sony Style stores for $799.99. Yes, you read right: $799.99. Sony Ericsson was very clear in stating that the Xperia X1 is aimed at customers looking for a high-end phone, but even so, this is a bit ridiculous. Aside from the interactive panels and a couple of multimedia extras, Xperia X1 is very much like other Windows Mobile 6.1 devices and the aforementioned features don''t seem to justify spending the extra dough. Unless you''ve got money to burn, we just can''t imagine spending $800 for the phone. It''s truly a luxury item. The Sony Ericsson Xperia X1 will be available for preorder on November 13 from the Sony Style Web site and will be in stores November 28.

Design
Smartphones with slide-out keyboards (a la AT&amp;amp;T Tilt and Sprint Mogul) have a tendency to be large and bulky, but this certainly isn''t the case with the Sony Ericsson Xperia X1. At 4.4 inches tall by 2.1 inches wide by 0.7 inch deep and 5.6 ounces, the Xperia X1 is compact and has a nice, solid construction. The phone is available in two colors: silver or black. We reviewed the silver model, which has an attractive steel finish and feels cool in the hand. The X1 definitely has wow factor and Sony Ericsson really did a nice job on the hardware.


For a device that has a slide-out full QWERTY keyboard, the Sony Ericsson Xperia X1 is quite a compact handset.
The Xperia X1 features a 3-inch touch screen that displays 65,536 colors at an 800x480 pixel resolution. With such a sharp resolution, it''s no surprise that images and text looked crisp and colors were vibrant. However, the highlight of the smartphone is the interactive panel interface. Sony Ericsson created this feature to give users one-touch access to the features they wanted and the ability to customize the smartphone to their lifestyle.

Basically, you can choose from nine panels and, depending on whether you''re at work or at play, you can pick whichever panel you want to fit your needs and have that be your Today screen for the day. Seven panels come preloaded on the device: Microsoft Today, Sony Ericsson (two variations), Google, 3D Fish, Xperia Radio, and Media Xperience. Most are self-explanatory, but if you''re curious about the 3D Fish, it basically shows you the date and time and then three or four fish, which each represent some type of notification. For example, the speckled fish (called Ryukin) alerts you to missed calls, and the other fish will turn from one color to another when your battery is low or if you have a new message. It''s all spelled out in the quick guides, but good luck remembering what everything means. You can also customize what type of information is displayed on the Today screen and add widgets to the Sony Ericsson panel, such as Web feeds and clocks and weathers for different cities.


The Sony Ericsson Xperia X1 allows you to customize your smartphone with nine interactive panels.
In addition to the standard seven panels, you''ll be able to download more panels from other developers through Sony Ericsson''s download site. Unfortunately, when we tried on our review phone, we were met with a 404-page not found. Sony Ericsson said the full site will be up and running by the time the X1 is out. While the X1 panel interface is a cool concept and we love the customization, in reality, we only used about three of the panels. It''s rare that we wanted multimedia or the radio to be at the forefront. This, of course, is a personal choice, though, and we appreciate the customization option.

Below the display, there is a navigation array that consists of two soft keys, Talk and End buttons, an X1 panel key, an OK button, and an optical joystick/directional keypad with a center select button. We weren''t huge fans of any of these controls, as they''re small and stiff to press, particularly the two sliverlike soft keys. We missed having a Home key. The optical joystick operates similar to the optical mouse on the Samsung Omnia and Samsung Epix, but like the Omnia, the trackpad is somewhat small, limiting how much you can move around on a page. Alternatively, you can press the outer edges of the trackpad (up, down, left, right), so it acts more like a traditional navigation toggle.


Below the touch screen, you''ll find a navigation array, which includes the X1 panel key, but we found these buttons small and stiff to press.
To access the keyboard, just slide the screen to the right. The sliding mechanism is smooth and feels strong enough to endure multiple openings and closings. In its open state, you''ll notice that there''s a slight arc to the phone. Sony Ericsson did this to provide a better ergonomic experience when using the keyboard, and we think it succeeds. The slight curve makes it comfortable to hold the phone when typing messages, and it also props the screen at a nice angle for better viewing. The screen orientation will also automatically switch from portrait to landscape mode when you open the phone. The keyboard itself is pretty good. The buttons are slightly on the smaller side but there''s enough spacing between them that we think it shouldn''t give most people problems. We were able to compose messages and enter text without too many errors, though the number keys are a bit hard to find at first.


The X1''s full QWERTY keyboard is spacious and easy to use.
On the left spine, you''ll find a mini USB port, while the right side holds a volume rocker and a camera activation/capture button. The latter two controls are somewhat tiny so they''re not the easiest to press; the volume rocker was particularly tricky, as it was hard to accurately press up or down while on a phone call. There''s a 3.5mm headphone jack and a power button on top of the handset. The camera is located on the back, and there is a microSD expansion slot, but you have to remove the back cover to access it, which is an inconvenience. Also, a minor issue but worth mentioning: there''s no release button or switch for the battery cover; you only get two little indentations on either side of the smartphone where you can pull it off with your fingernail, which wasn''t always the easiest thing to do.

The Sony Ericsson Xperia X1 comes packaged with an AC adapter, a USB cable, a 2GB microSD card, a wired headset, a software CD, and reference material. For more add-ons, please check our cell phone accessories, ringtones, and help page.

Features
Behind all the flash of the panel interface lies another Windows Mobile smartphone. The Sony Ericsson Xperia X1 runs Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional Edition, so you get the full Microsoft Office Mobile Suite and support for Microsoft''s Direct Push Technology for real-time message delivery and automatic synchronization with your Outlook calendar, tasks, and contacts via Exchange Server. In addition, you can access any POP3 and IMAP e-mail accounts that you have; we configured our review unit to get our Yahoo Mail by simply entering our log-in ID and password and we were set up in just a couple of minutes. Other PIM tools include a task list, a notepad, a calculator, and a PDF reader. For added functionality, you can always download more applications, and there''s even a shortcut included to the Handango store.

For Web browsing, the Xperia X1 ships with the Opera Mobile Web browser, in addition to the default Internet Explorer Mobile. There''s also Windows Live integration and the aforementioned Google panel, which gives you quick access to search, Gmail, and Google Maps. On the Sony Ericsson panel, you can get Web feeds from up to 10 of your favorite sites, and you can choose how frequently you want to receive updates. As far as connecting to the Web, the smartphone offers integrated Wi-Fi and 3G. The X1 supports the 850/1900/2100 UMTS/HSDPA bands, which means to get the 3.5G speeds in the States, you''ll need an AT&amp;amp;T SIM card. You''ll still be able to make calls and surf the Web with a T-Mobile SIM, but it will only be on EDGE speeds since the carrier''s 3G network runs on the 1700/2100MHz bands.

The Xperia X1''s phone features include quad-band world roaming, a speakerphone, conference calling, and text and multimedia messaging. The phone book is limited only by the available memory (the SIM card holds an additional 250 contacts), and there''s room in each entry for multiple numbers, e-mail addresses, instant-messaging handles, and birthdays. For caller ID purposes, you can assign a picture, one of 41 polyphonic ringtones, or a group ID. Bluetooth 2.0 is also onboard for use with mono and stereo Bluetooth headsets, hands-free kits, and dial-up networking.

The smartphone also comes equipped with assisted GPS. To speed up the process of determining your location, the X1 also includes a utility called QuickGPS that we''ve seen on a few GPS-equipped smartphones; it downloads the latest satellite information via an Internet connection. While Google Maps for Mobile comes preloaded on the X1, you will only get text-based driving directions from the app. For real-time tracking and voice-guided prompts, you''ll need a location-based service or online application like Wayfinder Navigation, which is provided on the software CD.

Sony Ericsson makes a big deal about the Xperia X1 being an all-in one device for both work and play, so it''s no surprise there are a number of multimedia goodies. The X1''s media interface is built to resemble Sony''s other consumer electronics, including the PlayStation, the PSP, and the Bravia TV line, so it may look familiar to any owners of those products. The media player supports MP3, MP4, M4A, AAC(+), WMA, WAV, MIDI, MPEG-4, WMV and other music and video formats. Other goodies include podcast support, a streaming media player, and an FM radio, though you have to use the included headset for the latter. The X1 has about 400MB of onboard memory, and the expansion slot can accept up to 16GB cards.


On back, you''ll find the Xperia X1''s 3.2 megapixel camera and flash.
Finally, the Xperia X1 comes equipped with a 3.2-megapixel camera with a number of advanced features. The camera''s interface is based on Sony''s CyberShot camera. For still images, there are five picture sizes, three quality settings, and six shooting modes. In addition to face detection, you can tap on an object on the screen to focus on it. There are also white balance options and various effects. These tools are also available for videos, and you have two scene options and two shooting modes.


Photo quality was decent, with rich colors and good object definition.
Picture quality was pretty good. Colors looked almost true to life and while we thought there was a bit of softness to the image, we were still able to clearly identify objects in the photo. Video quality was also good. There was minimal pixelation, even during scenes were there was a bit of movement and action.

Performance
We tested the quad-band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900; UMTS/HSDPA 850/1900/2100) Sony Ericsson Xperia X1 in San Francisco using AT&amp;amp;T service, and call quality was good. When making calls, we could hear a slight background hiss that subsided when our friends picked up. Audio was clear and there was very little voice distortion, and we used an airline''s voice-automated response system with no problem. We also didn''t experience any dropped calls during our test period. Friends had positive comments, saying that they couldn''t tell we were using a cell phone and there was good sound.

Unfortunately, the speakerphone quality wasn''t the greatest. Voices sounded a bit garbled and volume was weak. We were able to pair the X1 with the Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth headset and Motorola S9 Bluetooth Active Headphones. Using AT&amp;amp;T''s 3G network, the X1 took about 40 seconds to 1 minute to load graphics-intensive pages like CNET.com, while mobile sites for CNN and ESPN took about 10 seconds. As for multimedia performance, we watched a couple of WMV clips, which looked excellent on the X1''s sharp display. Playback was smooth as the images and sound were synchronized, and there was minimal pixelation to the picture. Of course, it helped that we played high-quality video. As with most smartphones, we weren''t particularly impressed with music playback through the phone''s speakers. Songs sounded very brassy, but we suspect many users won''t be listening to tunes this way, which is why we''re thrilled to see the inclusion of a 3.5mm headphone jack. We plugged in a pair of Shure E3s and enjoyed great sound quality.

Overall, the Xperia X1 was a responsive device. There''s a slight lag when you activate a new panel, and some sluggishness when we had numerous applications open--typical Windows Mobile behavior. No system stalls or crashes, however. Despite the HSDPA support, we found the Web browsing to be a little pokey compared to other smartphones.

The Xperia X1 has a rated battery talk time of 6 hours on 3G and 10 hours on GSM/EDGE and up to 20 days of standby time. The Xperia X1 knocked out an impressive 9 hours of continuous talk time in our battery drain tests.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:45' WHERE "id" = 47[0m

The new Samsung Knack for Verizon Wireless is one such device. Also called the SCH-U310, the Knack (no, we don''t get the name either) is one of the best basic phones we''ve seen. Behind an extremely well-built and intuitive design are excellent call quality and a solid, functional feature set that includes voice dialing. While this is an ideal phone for anyone looking for a basic phone for communication, large keys and simple menus also position it as a great option for seniors or cell phone newbies. You can get it for just $39.99 with a two-year contract. To find accessories for this phone, see our cell phone ringtones and accessories guide.

Design
The Samsung Knack won''t win beauty contests, but its straightforward, no-nonsense design is one of its greatest attributes. We were struck immediately by the simplicity of its style. The silver face is nicely offset by the dark gray skin while the sturdy construction gives the flip phone a comfortable, solid feel. The hinge, in particular, feels very nice; the Knack opens and closes with an audible click. The SCH-U310 is on the bulky side (3.78 by 2.01 by 0.74 inches) but its slim profile means that it can travel well. And at 3.63 ounces it won''t weigh you down too much.


The Knack''s external display is rather small, but we like the phone''s simple design.
The Knack''s one-inch external display is a bit smaller than we''d like, but it shows all the information you need, including the time, battery life, signal strength, and numeric caller ID. The display is monochrome (96x96 pixels), so it won''t show photo caller ID, but that''s not a problem on this caliber of phone. The text on the screen is relatively large but it''s too bad the font size isn''t adjustable. Also, we''d prefer being able to adjust its backlighting time.


The Knack''s left-spine controls are various colors for easy recognition.
A large, silver volume rocker sits on the left spine of the SCH-U310; we had no trouble finding it when on a call. On the right spine are the charger port, voice dialing control, and a 2.5mm headset jack, which are colored red, silver, and blue, respectively. Presumably the colors are meant to make the items more visible, but whatever the reason, we like the effect. We also like that the top half of the voice-dialing button gives convenient one-touch access to call your voice mailbox. The Knack''s single speaker sits at the top of its rear face.


The Knack''s speaker sits on its rear face.
Inside the phone is the large (2.25-inch), eye-catching display. Though it supports 65,000 colors (220x176 pixels), you''d hardly know it. Colors were vivid, graphics were sharp, and the entire screen is very bright. Fortunately, you can adjust the backlighting time and font size. But the best thing about the display is that--at least for the Knack--Verizon has ditched its confusing and much-maligned standardized-menu interface. Navigation was a breeze, as all options are arranged in a simple format. The arrangement should be particularly simple for anyone new to cell phones. We also like the SCH-U310''s nifty "Phone Info" menu, which puts a host of useful information at your fingerprints, including your phone number, the battery life percentage, the numbers of voice mails and messages, the volume setting, and an explanation of the onscreen icons. Again, it''s all very straightforward and simple for a first time cell phone user.

The spacious navigation array is well-designed, too. We also like how the silver keys compare with the black toggle. The array consists of two soft keys, a dedicated "911" key, a speakerphone button, Talk and End/power controls, a clear key, and a user-programmable "ICE" (in case of emergency button). The large, tactile keys should limit misdials, even for clumsy fingers. Indeed, we had no issues during our test period. The Knack''s toggle is spacious, as well, though it could be just a bit more tactile. On the downside, however, the central OK button is almost too small. The SCH-U310''s keypad buttons have large numbers with a bright backlighting. Given their large size and tactile definition we had no problems dialing, testing quickly, or dialing by feel.

Features
The Knack has a 500-contact phone book with room in each entry for four phone numbers. There''s no space for extraneous information like e-mail addresses or job titles, but that''s perfectly fine on a basic phone like this. You can''t set caller groups, which is a bit of a disappointment, but you can pair individual contacts with one of 23, 32-chord polyphonic ringtones.

Other features on the SCH-U310 include a vibrate mode, text messaging, a calendar, an alarm clock, a calculator, a world clock, a stopwatch, a tip calculator, a unit and currency converter, and a speakerphone. There''s no Bluetooth but the Knack offers speaker-independent voice dialing.

You can personalize the Knack with a variety of banners, wallpapers, and alert tones. There''s no Web browser, so you can''t download additional options. Though we understand the omission of the browser, it would be nice to have it just the same. The SCH-U310 doesn''t come with any games.

Performance 
We tested the dualband (CDMA 800/1900) Samsung Knack SCH-U310 in San Francisco using Verizon Wireless service. Call quality was very good by all accounts. The signal was clear and free of static, the volume was loud and voices sounded sharp and natural. Indeed, we had no complaints, and callers had only positive things to say. They could hear and understand us nearly all of the time and a few couldn''t even tell we were using a cell phone. It was only when we were talking in a store with a loud PA system that callers had trouble with the connection. Automated-calling systems had trouble understanding us under the same conditions. The Knack is compatible with M4/T4 hearing aids.

Speakerphone calls were almost as satisfactory. The volume on our end was very loud, even though the speaker faces the rear of the phone. Voices sounded a bit tinny, but that''s not unusual. On their end, callers reported few problems, as long as we were using the speakerphone in a quiet room.

The Knack has a rated battery life of 4.5 hours talk time and 14 days standby time. It has a tested talk time of 4 hours and 37 minutes. According to FCC radiation tests, the SCH-U310 has a digital SAR of 1.14 watts per kilogram.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:45' WHERE "id" = 50[0m

The latest manufacturer to jump on the bandwagon in the U.S. is Sanyo, which has just released the Sanyo SCP-2700 for Sprint. The SCP-2700 is not a feature-rich handheld by any means--it doesn''t have 3G or a music player--but it does have that full QWERTY keyboard with threaded text messaging, support for corporate e-mail, plus a 1.3-megapixel camera and Bluetooth. It''s also one of the cheapest messaging phones out there at only $29.99 with a two-year service agreement.

Design
The Sanyo SCP-2700 has a very straightforward design, and looks a little like a lower-end version of a BlackBerry, or a thicker version of the Pantech Slate. Measuring 4.3 inches long by 2.4 inches wide by 0.6 inch thick, the SCP-2700 is encased in glossy plastic with a checkered texture design on the back. The SCP-2700 is also quite lightweight at 3.4 ounces. It feels good in the hand, but the glossy surface does make it prone to fingerprints.


The Sanyo SCP-2700 has a simple, straightforward design.
On the front of the SCP-2700 is a decent 2.2-inch diagonal display with 65,536 colors and 320x240 pixel resolution. We would''ve liked 262,000 colors instead, but since the SCP-2700 isn''t a very high-end phone, we were fine with it. The screen looks nice and bright, and the text is legible and sharp. You can adjust the backlight time, the size of the input font, and the sleep mode timer.

Underneath the display is the navigation array, which consists of two soft keys, a square navigation toggle with middle confirmation key, a dedicated text-messaging key, a back key, and the Send and End/Power keys. The aforementioned toggle is mapped to four user-defined shortcuts, while the middle confirmation key leads to the main menu when on standby mode. All the keys are sufficiently raised above the surface, and are easy to use.


The Sanyo SCP-2700 has a very nice QWERTY keyboard.
Below the navigation array is the QWERTY keyboard, which is what makes the SCP-2700 a messaging phone. The keyboard is a little small, like that on the Palm Centro, but we really liked how tactile the keys are. The keys are raised above the surface, plus they have a bubble-like texture that makes it easy to type. There''s also a dedicated emoticon key that brings up the different emoticons while you''re typing out a text message. The dedicated speakerphone key is on the bottom right of the keyboard.

On the left spine are a charger jack, a dedicated camera key, and the volume rocker, while a 2.5mm headset jack sits on the right spine. On the back is the camera lens and an external speaker. There is no flash or self-portrait mirror.

Features
The Sanyo SCP-2700 doesn''t have a lot of features going for it, but it does do messaging very well, which suits its primary purpose. It has a basic 600-entry phone book, with room in each entry for six phone numbers, three e-mail addresses, a Web URL, a street address, and a memo. You can assign contacts with a photo for caller ID and to different caller groups as well. You can also assign one of 37 polyphonic ringtones for incoming calls, text messages, picture mails, and voice SMS. Other basic features include a vibrate mode, a speakerphone, text and multimedia messaging, an alarm clock, a calendar, a countdown timer, a stopwatch, a voice memo recorder, and a world clock. There''s also a wireless Web browser, Bluetooth, instant messaging (AIM, Windows Live, and Yahoo), e-mail, and voice SMS. There''s also GPS support for location-based services like Sprint Navigator.

Truly, the star feature of the SCP-2700 lies in its messaging applications. It doesn''t just have the standard text message functionality; it also supports threaded text messages, which are usually available on higher-end smart phones only. This means you get to view a text message within the context of a conversation, rather than as just a single message.

The SCP-2700 also supports multiple e-mail accounts from an array of providers like Sprint''s own PCS Mail, AOL, Hotmail, Yahoo, and Gmail, as well as your own POP or IMAP e-mail account. Only PCS Mail requires a Web browser to access. Amazingly, the SCP-2700 can also receive your work e-mail. You can either use your employer''s Outlook Web Access or use Sprint''s own Mobile E-mail Personal Account. The latter requires a software download and a rather tedious Web interface that will link your work e-mail to the phone, so it''s best if your company has OWA running.

The messaging interface is very intuitive. Navigation is easy, and you can choose how many messages you want to see in your in-box. Do note that you have to switch between different in-boxes for your different e-mail accounts. Also, for your work account, you can''t get to any of your other incoming mail folders aside from the primary in-box. This can be annoying if you have filters set up to redirect your mail to separate e-mail folders.


The Sanyo SCP-2700 has a 1.3-megapixel camera.
Also on the SCP-2700 is a 1.3-megapixel camera. It can take pictures in three resolutions (1,280x960, 640x480, and 320x240), and three quality settings. Other camera options include a brightness setting, five white balance presets, plus a manual mode, sharpness control, contrast, a self-timer, up to 12x digital zoom, five picture modes, multiple shot settings, fun frames, eight color tones, three shutter sounds, and a silent option. Photo quality was poor: images looked washed out and dull with quite a bit of pixelation as well. There''s no camcorder built in.


The Sanyo SCP-2700 has poor photo quality.
You can customize the SCP-2700 with different screensavers and ring or alert tones. It comes with a few games, like demo versions of Block Breaker Deluxe 2 and Monopoly Here & Now, and Guitar Hero World Tour. It also comes with NASCAR Sprint Cup Mobile, NFL Mobile Live, and Social Zone in the Applications folder. If you want, you can purchase more graphics, ringers, games, and applications via Sprint''s Web browser.

Performance
We tested the dual-mode (CDMA 800/1900; 1xRTT) Sanyo SCP-2700 in San Francisco using Sprint''s service. Call quality was very impressive. Callers could hear us loud and clear without a lot of background sound. We could hear them clearly as well, though there was the occasional static and hiss. Speakerphone quality wasn''t as good, with a bit more of a tinny quality to the callers'' voices, but we could still carry on a conversation.

The SCP-2700 has a rated battery life of 4.8 hours talk time. According to FCC radiation tests, the Sanyo SCP-2700 has a digital SAR rating of 1.25 watts per kilogram.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:45' WHERE "id" = 53[0m

It looks similar to Samsung Propel, with a slider form factor and full QWERTY keyboard, but the Pro is designed more for business users and adds Windows Mobile 6.1 along with a toned-down look that''s more appropriate for the board room. The smartphone delivers good call quality and is packed with a broad range of wireless connections and e-mail capabilities. However, like its nonsmartphone counterpart, we had problems with the design. The Propel Pro is bulky and thick, and when compared with other sleek QWERTY smartphones like the Samsung Epix and Nokia E71x, it loses some of its appeal. However, if you''re a fan of slider phones and need one to handle your business, the Propel Pro can do that for you. The Samsung Propel Pro will be available from AT&T starting April 14 for $149.99 with a two-year contract.

Design
The Samsung Propel Pro captures your attention for a couple of reasons, the first of which is its shiny exterior. The smoky mirrored chassis is definitely eye-catching and tones down the Samsung Propel''s playful image with a classic and corporate-appropriate look. However, the shiny surface gets dirty pretty quickly, as it holds many fingerprints and smudges; we had to constantly wipe the screen. Also, the back of the handset can feel slick, almost greasy. All these issues sap the smartphone of some of its initial allure.


The Samsung Propel Pro is slightly bulky.
The second reason you take notice of the Propel Pro is because of the slider phone''s squat, squarish shape. Though we''ve seen more handsets come in this shape, including the LG Lotus and Verizon Wireless Blitz, it''s still uncommon; and to our recollection, it''s the first smartphone we''ve seen with this design. That''s not necessarily a bad thing, however; it''s just different. In all, the Propel Pro measures 3.9 inches tall by 2.4 inches wide by 0.6 inch thick, and weighs 4.8 ounces, so it''s quite a bulky handset. The smartphone feels wide when held in the hand and you might want to put this into your coat pocket, since it''s not going to easily slip into the pocket of your pants.

On front, there is a 2.5-inch, 65,000-color TFT nontouch display with a 320x320 pixel resolution. It could stand to be a little bigger and there''s certainly room, but overall, we found it sharp and easy to read. Like most cell phone screens, the Propel Pro''s tends to wash out a bit in bright sunlight. You can customize the Home screen with various layouts, color schemes, and background images. We particularly like the sliding panel layout since it provides easy access to your information and applications right from the Home screen.

Without a touch screen, the controls beneath the display will be your main way to navigate the phone. You get two soft keys, Talk and End buttons, a Home shortcut, a back button, and a navigation joystick. The controls are fairly easy to use, with the exception of the joystick. It doesn''t provide the most precise method for scrolling and selecting menu items. For example, on several occasions, we inadvertently moved the joystick when we were simply trying to press down to select something. It gets easier with more time, but still, it doesn''t offer you complete control like a traditional directional keypad or trackball.


Below the display, you''ll find some navigation controls. We weren''t huge fans of the joystick since it wasn''t very precise.
To access the full QWERTY keyboard, simply push the screen up. The sliding motion is smooth and the screen securely locks into place. The Propel Pro''s keyboard is slightly different from the regular Samsung Propel. The buttons are rectangular instead of oval shaped and there''s no spacing between the keys, making it slightly cramped and troublesome for users with larger thumbs. The spacebar was particularly problematic, since it''s so short; we''d have preferred it slightly longer (and it looks like there was space to do so). On the positive side, the buttons weren''t stiff to press as they were on the Samung BlackJack II, so that reduced some typing errors.


The Propel Pro''s full QWERTY keyboard features good-size buttons that are easy to press. However, the layout is a bit cramped.
On the left side, there''s a power button, a volume rocker, and a microSD expansion slot; and on the right spine, you''ll find a camera activation/capture button and Samsung''s pesky proprietary power/headset jack. We really hope Samsung considers switching to a more standard Mini- or Micro-USB port and a 3.5mm headphone jack in the future, since having to use Samsung-specific accessories is quite annoying and restricting. Finally, the camera is built into the back of the front cover, so you need to slide open the phone in order to use it.

The Samsung Propel Pro comes packaged with an AC adapter, a USB cable, a software CD, and reference material. For more add-ons, please check our cell phone accessories, ringtones, and help page.

Features
While not drastically different from other Windows Mobile smartphones, the Samsung Propel Pro does ramp up the offerings of the Samsung Propel with the addition of Windows Mobile 6.1 Standard Edition--bringing with it document viewing and editing via the Microsoft Office Mobile Suite and Outlook synchronization courtesy of Microsoft''s Direct Push Technology. The Propel Pro offers other e-mail solutions as well, including AT&T''s Xpress Mail and continued support for POP3 and IMAP accounts. In addition, the smartphone comes preloaded with three instant-messaging clients: AIM, Windows Live, and Yahoo.

Other personal-information management tools include a PDF viewer, an RSS reader, a task list, voice notes, alarm and world clocks, a unit converter, a stopwatch, and more. You can, of course, download more applications to the smartphone, and there are plenty of titles available for the Windows Mobile operating system. AT&T includes some extras on the device, including MobiTV, My-Cast Weather, eBay, Mobile Banking, and WikiMobile; for more, check out Download.com. For storage, the Propel Pro has 126MB RAM/256MB ROM, but for any personal or media files, we''d recommend sideloading them on a microSD card. The smartphone''s expansion slot can accept up to 8GB cards.


On the left side, there is a microSD expansion slot that can accept 8GB cards.
Switching to the voice features, the Samsung Propel Pro offers quad-band world roaming, a speakerphone, speed dialing, three-way calling, conference calling, voice commands, and text and multimedia messaging. We should note that the smartphone does support threaded text messages. You can also make video calls via AT&T''s Video Share service, though the recipient will also have to have a Video Share-compatible phone and you''ll have to sign up for the service, which starts at $4.99 per month.

The contacts list is pretty standard, with room in each entry for multiple numbers, e-mail addresses, IM handles, notes, and more. The address book is limited by available memory only (the SIM card holds an additional 250 contacts). For caller ID, you can assign a contact a picture, a group ID, or a custom ringtones.

The Propel Pro is Bluetooth 2.0 capable, so you can pair the handset with mono and stereo Bluetooth headsets and hands-free kits. There''s also support for Bluetooth peripherals (keyboards, printers, and so forth), and wireless file transfers. You can also use the smartphone as a wireless modem for your laptop.

That''s too bad, since the smartphone is a tri-band UMTS/HSDPA (850/1900/2100MHz). The 3.5G support brings data speeds that are more comparable to a broadband-like connection, but remember that there are multiple factors that affect 3G speeds, such as where you live and how many people are on the network at one time, so results may vary. The tri-band support means you''ll be able to access 3G networks while abroad, as well. As an alternative, the Propel Pro also has integrated Wi-Fi, so you don''t always have to rely on AT&T''s network. Just be sure to turn off all unnecessary radios to preserve battery life.

The Epix also features GPS/A-GPS. While you can get maps and text-based, turn-by-turn driving directions with a free app like Google Maps for Mobile, for real-time tracking, data, and voice-guided directions, you''ll need to use location-based service. Conveniently, AT&T offers its own version of TeleNav Navigator, which offers traffic data and location recorders in addition to voice-guided instructions. Currently, AT&T Navigator is free for the first 30 days, but afterwards, you will be charged $9.99 per month unless you cancel the feature.

If you''re looking for a little bit of fun, the Samsung Propel Pro can provide that, too. In addition to the standard Windows Media Player, you can enjoy streaming music and video via AT&T Music and AT&T Video. These add-on services enable you to access content, such as streaming XM satellite radio, music videos, MusicID for identifying song titles and artist, and video programming from CNN, ESPN, and NBC, among other channels.


The Samsung Propel Pro is equipped with a 3-megapixel camera/camcorder with autofocus.
The Propel Pro also features a 3-megapixel camera with video-recording capabilities and autofocus. For still shots, you get a choice of various shooting modes, scenes, resolutions, and image qualities, as well as white balance and ISO controls. In camcorder mode, available settings include two resolutions, three quality settings, white balance, effects, and a couple of others.


We were impressed by the sharp images and good color.
Picture quality was quite impressive. We were a little wary, since there was some shutter lag so we feared that photos might come out blurry. However, we were pleasantly surprised when we saw the end product. The image was nice and sharp, and, for once, colors didn''t look completely washed out or too orange or yellow like they do on some other smartphones. Video quality was also good, with minimal blurriness or pixilation.

Performance
We tested the quad-band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900)/tri-band UMTS/HSDPA Samsung Propel Pro in San Francisco using AT&T service and call quality was good. The audio was clear on our end, though just slightly hollow sounding. Still, we were able to carry on conversations without interruption and our friends also reported positive results. Speakerphone quality was also satisfactory. In most cases, volume was loud enough even in relatively noisy environments, but there was some occasional crackling. We were able to pair the Propel Pro with the Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth headset and the Motorola S9 Bluetooth Active Headphones.

Armed with a 528MHz processor, the Propel Pro is generally responsive. We didn''t experience any major delays or system crashes during our review period, though we did see our share of the spinning wheel while waiting for a program to launch.

Our review unit had no problem finding and connecting to our Wi-Fi network. Using AT&T''s 3G network, it took about one minute for CNET''s site to fully load on Internet Explorer Mobile. CNN Mobile came up in 16 seconds, while ESPN Mobile took 18 seconds. We watched a couple of video streams from AT&T Video, and it wasn''t pretty. The stream was often interrupted and the picture was very pixilated and blurry. It simply wasn''t worth it. Fortunately, we had better luck with WMV clips from our personal library, as picture and audio played seamlessly. We were also impressed by the rich sound of the phone''s speakers when playing back music.

To test the smartphone''s GPS, we used AT&T Navigator and plotted a course from the Marina district of San Francisco to CNET''s downtown headquarters. The Propel was able to find our location immediately and did a fairly decent job of tracking our position throughout the drive, though it occasionally lagged behind by about half a block. While the directions were accurate, we encountered some problems with route recalculations. They were often slow and by the time it came up with new directions, it had to play catch up, and sometimes got confused with street names.

The Samsung Propel Pro''s 1440mAh lithium ion battery has a rated talk time of 6.5 hours and up to 12 days of standby time. In our battery drain tests, we were able to get an impressive 10 hours of continuous talk time on a single charge. According to FCC radiation tests, the Propel Pro has a digital SAR rating of 0.473 watt per kilogram.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:45' WHERE "id" = 56[0m

CNET editors'' review

Reviewed by: Bonnie Cha
Reviewed on: 03/31/2009
Traditionally, the Nokia E series, which includes the Nokia E71, have been very business-focused and slightly on the pricey side, but the cell phone manufacturer is hoping to attract more consumers by offering its Nokia E63 at a lower price point. Announced for the U.S. market at CES 2009, the E63 is available now for $279 through Nokia''s flagship stores in New York and Chicago. Compare that price with the E71, which goes for $500 unlocked, or any other unlocked phone, and you''ve got a pretty good deal, especially when you consider that the E63 offers a full QWERTY keyboard, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 2.0, and all the e-mail and productivity capabilities of the E71. The only thing you lose is integrated GPS, and you get a lesser camera. Of course, some of that value is lost now that AT&T has announced that it will offer the Nokia E71x for $99.99 with a two-year contract. Plus, the E63''s call quality is a little spotty. Still for those who don''t want to be tied down to a carrier and want the freedom of an unlocked phone, the Nokia E63 offers a good set of features for more casual users and at a more affordable price.

Design
It''d be easy to call the Nokia E63 a thicker, plasticky version of the Nokia E71 and call it a day, but that would be unfair to the E63. Admittedly, we do miss the steel chassis and sleeker profile of the E71, but the E63 isn''t an ugly beast. In fact, it''s quite attractive and as a more consumer-centric device, Nokia brings a fresher, hipper look to the smartphone by offering the phone in red or blue.


The Nokia E63 is a more consumer-centric smartphone compared to the Nokia E71.
The E63 mostly keeps the same dimensions of the E71 (4.4 inches tall by 2.2 inches wide and 4.4 ounces) but is just a hair thicker (0.5 inch vs. 0.4 inch), so it''ll make for a bit of a tight fit in a pants pocket. Despite its plastic casing, the smartphone has a solid construction and feels comfortable to hold while on a call or typing messages. The E63 also has a soft-touch finish on back to give it a nonslippery texture.

On front, you''ll find a 2.36-inch QVGA (320x240 pixels) nontouch display that supports up to 16 million colors. The screen is vibrant and bright and is equipped with a light-sensing technology that adjusts the display''s brightness depending on your environment. We were able to read the screen in most lighting conditions, though colors were slightly washed out in bright sunlight, not unlike other smartphones. For customization, you can change the Home screen''s background image, theme, and font size and choose between a grid or list menu view.

Like the E71, the E63 also offers two different views, depending on whether you''re at work or at home. In Business mode, you''ll have immediate access to work tools, such as e-mail, the Web, and the file manager. Meanwhile, switching to Personal mode gives you instant access to your multimedia library, the Web, and messages. How effective this functionality is at taking your mind off work is questionable since you can simply switch back to Business mode with a click of a button, but hey, we appreciate the capability and the thought behind it.


The E71''s QWERTY keyboard features slightly larger buttons for easy typing, though they''re a bit mushy.
Below the display, you''ll find the same navigation array of two soft keys, Talk and End buttons, four shortcuts (Home, Calendar, Contacts, and Messages), and a four-way toggle with a center select key. The full QWERTY keyboard is similar to the E71''s, but there are some differences. For example, the bottom row includes more keys, and as a result, the space bar is smaller. This didn''t pose a problem, however, and the individual buttons are also larger, so the overall typing experience was good. If anything, our only complaint would be that the keys feel a bit soft and mushy when you press them.


On the left side, you''ll find a micro USB port and a microSD expansion slot that accepts up to 8GB cards.
On the left side of the smartphone, there''s a micro-USB port and a microSD expansion slot. Curiously and disappointingly, Nokia got rid of the dedicated volume controls and user-programmable shortcut key found present on the E71. You can adjust the volume using the E63''s navigation toggle, which is fine when you''re using the media player, but not so easy when you''re on a call since you have to pull the phone away from your ear to do so.

There''s a power connector on the bottom, and a 3.5mm headphone jack on top. The latter is protected by a cover, but it''s tiny and not attached to the phone so chances are pretty high that it''ll get lost at some point. That said, we''re absolutely thrilled that Nokia made the switch from a 2.5mm jack to 3.5mm so you can use the smartphone with your favorite pair of headphones.

The Nokia E63 is a little shabby in the accessories department. The smartphone comes packaged with an AC adapter, a wired headset, and reference material, but there''s no USB cable included in the box. For more add-ons, please check our cell phones accessories, ringtones, and help page.

Features
The Nokia E63''s feature set is largely like the Nokia E71, except it lacks GPS and is equipped with a 2-megapixel camera instead of a 3.2-megapixel camera. We point out some of the highlights and differences in the Performance section below, but for more information about the Nokia E63''s feature set, please check out our full review of the Nokia E71.

Performance
We tested the quad-band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900; WCDMA 850/1900) Nokia E63, and call quality was mixed. To us, calls sounded great with good volume and clear sound. There was minimal background noise or distortion, but this wasn''t the case on the other end. One friend said that the audio kept cutting in and out, so he couldn''t fully understand what we were saying. I called him back two more times to see if it was a connection problem, and the call was dropped during the second attempt and sound quality only improved marginally on the third try. Another friend also reported lots of static and choppiness, while a third person said the call quality was fine. Surprisingly, the speakerphone offered better sound quality as callers could hear the full conversation without any type of disruption.

We successfully paired the E63 with the Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth headset and the Motorola S9 Bluetooth Active Headphones. Though there''s no integrated GPS, you can pair the smartphone with a Bluetooth GPS receiver to get turn-by-turn directions. It''s another accessory you will have to carry, but at least, it''s an option. The E63 also support stereo Bluetooth, dial-up networking, file transfer, object push, and more.

The E63 supports AT&T''s 850/1900 3G bands but not 3.5G HSDPA. Note that the smartphone also isn''t compatible with T-Mobile''s 3G network, as it runs on the 1700/2100MHz bands. Using AT&T''s 3G network, it took the smartphone about a minute to fully load CNET''s page, while it took about 35 seconds for ESPN''s and CNN''s mobiles sites to come up. The Nokia Web browser is quite good. It allows you to toggle between multiple windows, navigate to a point on a site by the using page overview, and best of all, offers Flash Lite 3.0 support, so you''re able to view and use such sites as YouTube. We checked out a couple of clips and were quite impressed by the good quality and uninterrupted stream. There''s even a full-screen option.

The Nokia E63 is a fast little machine. We used multiple applications, including QuickOffice for document editing, e-mail, and multimedia, and rarely encountered delays of more than a few seconds. The smartphone also provided smooth playback of songs and video.

The picture quality of the E63''s 2-megapixel camera wasn''t the best. Images were clear, and coloring was good as long as there was plenty of natural light. In all other situations, the photos looked gray and washed out, even with the use of a flash. The results were about the same with recorded video clips, though overall, we were impressed by the clarity of the picture. The E63 includes 110MB of internal memory, which can be expanded by the microSD expansion slot (accepts up to 8GB cards).


We weren''t impressed by the E63''s camera.
The Nokia E63 comes with a 1500mAh lithium ion battery with a rated talk time of 11 hours (GSM) and 4 hours and 40 minutes (HSDPA) and up to 18 days (GSM)/20 days (HSDPA) of standby time. In our battery drain tests we were able to get 9 hours of continuous talk time on a single charge.

Though we expected a second Instinct at some point, the S30 is more of a minor redesign than a full-blown revamp of the original model. It''s the tinniest bit thinner with smoother angles, but it only adds minimal new features. And even worse, it removes at least two things that we enjoyed on the first model. The Instinct S30 is available for $129 with a contract. That''s a fair price, but the Instinct S30 falls short of being both new and improved. It''s disappointing considering how we liked the first handset.

The Instinct S30, aka the SPH-M810, has the same basic shape as its predecessor, but a side-by-side comparison will show a more aerodynamic profile and smoother lines and rounded corners. It also has a slight bulge at the bottom end. The S30 is almost the same size (4.57 inches tall by 2.11 inches wide by 0.48 inch thick), but it''s just 0.1 inch thinner than the original Instinct and a tad lighter (3.88 ounces). Overall, we like the new look--it''s less boxy and the phone has a nicer feeling in the hand. You can get it in two colors--cobalt metal and copper--but the features are the same on both models.


The S30''s virtual keyboard is unchanged form the previous Instinct.
The S30''s touch screen is just a bit larger than the original handset (3.2 inches versus 3.1 inches). We welcome the change, though you''d barely notice it when using the device. The color resolution is the same (262,000 colors; 432,240-pixels) and the easy-to-use, customizable menus are unchanged. The touch screen felt no different, as well.

Outside on the display you''ll find the same exterior controls and an identical virtual dialpad and QWERTY keyboard. The memory card slot is again on the left spine. Samsung kept the proprietary charger jack, but we were glad that the company didn''t didn''t mess with the 3.5mm headset jack.

Features
The Instinct S30 offers many of the same features as the original Instinct. You''ll find stereo Bluetooth, a personal organizer, voice dialing and commands, GPS with Sprint Navigation, support for Sprint''s Visual Voicemail, FM radio, PC syncing, messaging, IMAP4 and POP3 e-mail, USB mass storage, 600-contact phonebook, and a full HTML browser. Unfortunately, the 2-megapixel shooter still doesn''t offer camera editing features, but photo quality was quite good.


Like its predecessor, the S30 has a self-portrait mirror, but no flash.
New features on the Instinct include an Opera 4.2 browser and more internal memory (32GB versus 16GB). You also get instant messaging, calendar, and contacts syncing out of the box. The precious Instinct required an upgrade to add both features. We were hoping for Wi-Fi this time around, but it''s not here.


The S30 promises admirable photo quality.
The S30 is also a 3G EV-DO device that supports Sprint''s NFL Mobile, Nascar application, Power Vision, and the Sprint Music Store. Yet, we were blown away that Sprint and Samsung downgraded the 3G support. Instead of EV-DO Rev. A, the S30 supports the carrier''s lower EV-DO Rev. 0 network. The means that instead of download speeds of 600Kbps to 1.4Mbps, you''ll get 400Kbps to 700Kbps. Similarly, upload speeds will average about 50Kpbs to 70Kbps instead of 350Kpbs to 500Kpbs. While the Rev. 0 speeds may be fine for some people, we can''t imagine why a second-generation device offers slower wireless data speeds.

We also were disappointed that the S30 does not come with the extra battery that could be charged separately in its carrying case. That was a nice touch on the previous phone.

Samsung is promising that the S30 will be more open to developers, who will be able to access the core Java application programming interface. Available features will include messaging, multimedia, contacts, calendar, and Bluetooth. As part of the program, Sprint is creating an Application Developer Program. We''ll give you more details on this program as they are made available.

Performance
We tested the dual-band (CDMA 800/1900; EV-DO) Samsung Instinct S30 in San Francisco using Sprint service. Call quality was somewhat improved over the first model. We experienced none of the patchy and harsh audio that we had before. For the most part, we enjoyed a clear signal without any interference. Voices sounded natural except at the highest volume level (the phone can get pretty loud).

On their end, callers said we sounded fine. They could tell we were using a call phone, but they reported fewer problems than on the Instinct. They only times they had trouble hearing us was when were in a particularly noisy locations. It was the same experience with automated calling systems. Speakerphone calls were average. The audio was a bit distorted muffed and the volume didn''t get as loud as we''d like.

Streaming video quality was as mixed as on its predecessor. Videos loaded quickly, but videos paused a few times while playing and there was a bit of choppy motion. On one occasion, the video was so pixelated that we couldn''t make out what was going on, but that was the exception. The audio was mostly in sync, though as with the speakerphone it could be louder. Music quality was fine, though headphones will provide the best experience.

The Web browser performed well for the most part. Simple Web pages loaded quickly, but busier pages took longer. For instance, CNET''s Web site took about 15 seconds from start to finish. Again, the downgrade to Rev 0 is a mystery. On the upside, it''s pretty easy to navigate around pages using the touch screen and the internal performance was zippy.

The Instinct S30 has a rated battery life of 4.6 hours talk time, which is more than an hour shorter than the original Instinct. According to FCC radiation charts, the S30 has a digital SAR of 1.33 watts per kilogram.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:45' WHERE "id" = 61[0m

  [4;35;1mBackground Update (0.5ms)[0m   [0mUPDATE "backgrounds" SET "data" = 'The market for rugged phones remains relatively small, but it shows no signs of waning. For a long time Sprint and Nextel had a monopoly on sturdy designs--Sprint with Sanyo models and Nextel with Motorola handsets--but other carriers have begun to catch up. Last fall, AT&T offered its second rugged phone, the Samsung Rugby, and now it adds yet another with the Samsung SGH-A657. Built like a brick, and shaped like one too, the SGH-A657 looks as if it could take quite a few blows. It''s not fashion-forward, but its hard shell and rubber sidings should appeal to the danger seeking and the danger-prone. Features are respectable--there''s no camera, but you get 3G, push-to-talk, Bluetooth, and GPS. It''s available through AT&T''s business channel for $129 with service.

Design
The SGH-A657 won''t win any beauty contests, but it''s perfectly OK with not entering them in the first place. This phone''s built to withstand the elements and protect its working parts from any bumps and bruises. It may not be quite as burly as the Motorola i365, but it certainly makes a respectable showing on the front. It is certified to military specifications for moisture, dust, shock, vibration, and the like. We splashed some water on it to no effect (it''s not fully waterproof, so it won''t survive a full dunking) and we dropped it onto a concrete floor without a scratch.

The phone has a plastic shell, but it''s covered in a very thin rubber material that gives it a sturdy and weighty feel in the hand. Rubber sidings protect the corners, but they also run up and down both spines. They have a ribbed pattern, which you can grip easily. Even with all the protection, the SGH-A657 isn''t terribly bulky. It measures 4.53 inches tall by 2.05 inches wide by 0.77 inch thick and weighs 4.34 ounces

The two-inch display is quite sharp. With support for 262,000 colors (220x176-pixel resolution), it''s bright and easy on the eyes. Colors are vibrant and graphics are sharp. The menu interface is available in two styles--list or icon--but both are intuitive (the submenus are particularly easy to use). You can change the backlighting time and the dialing font type, size, and color.

The square navigation toggle is tactile, and its silver color distinguishes it from the rest of the navigation array. We had no issues using the toggle to navigate through the menus. The central OK button has a nice squishy feel, but we wish that in standby mode it opened the main menu instead of starting the Web browser. Other navigation controls include two soft keys, which are a bit narrow, a GPS shortcut, a back button, and the Talk and End/power keys.

The keypad buttons also are raised above the surface of the phone. Texting and dialing was a breeze with the keys giving off an audible click when pressed. They also have a bright backlighting for dialing in the dark.


The SGH-A657''s battery cover has a locking mechanism.
On its left spine are a volume rocker and a bright orange push-to-talk button. On its right spine, you''ll find a flashlight button and the charger port/headset jack. Unfortunately, both are proprietary, which means your choices for peripherals will be limited. Samsung is getting better about including a standard Micro-USB charger connection, but it has a way to go. On the upside, however, the remaining control opens a nifty onscreen shortcut menu.


The SGH-A657 has a bright flashlight on its top end.
A small flashlight sits on the top of the phone next to the looped antenna. It''s quite bright for its size, so it should be useful if you lose your keys or can''t find the door in a dark room. The battery cover uses a locking mechanism so it should stay secure under most conditions. You must remove the battery and cover to access the memory card slot. Normally we''d complain about such an arrangement, but we''ll let it pass here since the SGH-A657''s design is all about durability.

Features
The SGH-A657 has a hefty 1,000-contact phone book with room in each entry for six phone numbers, an e-mail address, an instant messaging handle, and notes. Of course, you can save callers to groups and pair them with a photo and one of 10 (72-chord) polyphonic ringtones. The SIM card holds an additional 250 names.

Basic features include a vibrate mode, text and multimedia messaging, call timers, an alarm clock, a calendar, a task list, a notepad, a calculator, a unit and currency converter, a tip calculator, a world clock, a timer, and a stopwatch. You''ll also find stereo Bluetooth, USB syncing and mass storage, a voice recorder, instant messaging, access to AT&T''s PTT network and support for the carrier''s AT&T Navigator GPS service. On the downside, e-mail is limited to Web-based POP3 access, and there''s no voice dialing.

The SGH-A657 supports AT&T''s Cellular Video service, which offers tons of streaming-video content, and AT&T Mobile Music, which brings wireless song downloads through a variety of partners. The experience on the two applications is similar to that on other AT&T phones; both are minimalist in their designs, but the music player supports a wide variety of file formats and it offers useful features, such as album art, playlists, and shuffle, and repeat modes.

For audiophiles, the handset also has a solid selection of music-related features, such as support for XM Radio Mobile, a Music ID application, a Billboard Mobile channel, music videos, and a community section with access to fan sites and downloads. We especially welcome the application that lets you create your own ringtones and save music tracks as ringtones. You can personalize the SGH-A657 with a variety of themes, background colors, wallpaper, and a greeting message. More options and additional ringtones are available from AT&T using its wireless Web browser. The phone offers demo versions of thee games--Midnight Pool 3D, Tetris, and World Poker Tour Hold Em 2--you''ll have to buy the full versions for extended play.

Performance
We tested the quad-band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) Samsung SGH-A657 world phone in San Francisco using T-Mobile service. Call quality was more than respectable. We enjoyed clear conversation with a strong signal. There was little static and no interference from other electronic devices. Volume was softer than we''d like, but voices sounded natural, and the phone didn''t pick up excessive background noise.

On their end, callers said we sounded fine. They could tell that we were using a cell phone, but that''s hardly unusual. Most of our friends also reported the soft volume, but it should be fine unless you''re in an excessively noisy place. We had a similar experience with automated calling systems--we were understood as long as we were inside.

Speakerphone calls were quite good. The volume was much louder than with standard calls, and the audio was clear. Callers could hear us even when we were a few feet from the phone.

Unfortunately, streaming video was mostly poor. The display size is just too small and the images suffered from excessive pixelation and choppy motion. What''s more, the audio wasn''t always in sync, and videos paused to buffer. They only bright spot was the videos loaded quickly thanks to the strong 3G (UMTS; HSDPA 850/1900) connection.

Music quality was a bit better. The external speaker has a strong output, though the audio lacked range. Headphones will provide the best experience.

The SGH-A657 has a rated battery life of three hours take time, which is rather low for a GSM phone. Promised standby time is 10.5 days. According to FCC radiation tests, the SGH-QA657 has a digital SARof 0.682 watt per kilogram.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:45' WHERE "id" = 64[0m

Not so with LG''s latest messaging phone, the LG Xenon, available from AT&T Wireless.

Not only does the Xenon have a slide-out QWERTY keyboard for messaging, it also has a large touch-screen interface similar to the one on the LG Vu. Unlike the Vu however, the Xenon has a home screen customizable with widgets, dedicated pages for favorite contacts and applications, and something called the "Annunciator," which is essentially a drop-down menu of certain shortcuts. Aside from that, the Xenon has almost the same features as the Vu: a 2-megapixel camera, a music player, a full HTML browser, stereo Bluetooth, and more.

Though we weren''t thrilled with the Web browsing experience, we were overall pleased with the Xenon and think it makes an excellent messaging phone for AT&T customers. The LG Xenon is available for $99.99 with a two-year service agreement.

Design
At first glance, the LG Xenon appears to be just another touch-screen phone. Measuring 4.16 inches long by 2.11 inches wide by 0.62 inch thick, the Xenon has smooth, sleek lines all around, with a touch of chrome around the border. It''s a little smaller than the LG Vu and a little thicker as well. The Xenon is fairly lightweight at 3.81 ounces, and it''s slim enough to fit in a front pocket.


The LG Xenon looks like a touch-screen phone from the front.
Dominating its entire front surface is a large 2.8-inch touch-screen display. It''s smaller than the 3-inch displays on the LG Dare and the LG Vu, but it still looks good. It supports 262,000 colors and 240x400 pixels, which result in great-looking graphics and colorful images. You can view the date, time, battery life, signal strength, and photo caller ID. Even when the screen is locked, you can see the date and time in a screen overlay. You can set the brightness, the backlight timer, and the font size. For dialing fonts, you can set the color as well.

Along the top of the screen are three icons, each of which corresponds to one of three customizable standby screens. You get one just for your favorite contacts, one for the home screen, and one for your favorite application shortcuts. All standby screens have four shortcut icons along the bottom, which correspond to the phone dialer, the contacts list, the messaging menu, and the main menu. The main menu interface is similar to the one on the Vu, with four tabs along the right to differentiate applications. You get one tab for Phone-related apps, one for Multimedia, one for My Stuff (which includes the media gallery plus productivity tools), and another for Settings.

For the favorite contacts screen, just follow the instructions to add a contact from your phone book. The contacts will then appear as small icons with the person''s name, phone number, and photo. You can have up to three pages of favorite contacts, and you can arrange them on the screen however you wish by dragging and dropping the icons, or you can align them with the grid. You can also fix the icons so they don''t change position with the screen orientation. As for the shortcuts screen, you can add up to nine shortcuts. To add and remove shortcuts, simply press and hold down on a shortcut icon.

The home screen is also customizable with a variety of widgets, similar to the TouchWiz interface on some Samsung phones. On the bottom left of the Xenon''s home screen is a little right arrow that opens up to reveal a tray of widgets. There are only six to choose from, though; there''s an analog clock, a world clock, the calendar, sticky notes, the image gallery, and the music player. To add a widget to the home screen, just drag and drop it on the page. You can then close the tray by pressing the little left arrow.

The LG Xenon also has a drop-down shortcuts menu it calls the "Annunciator." Simply tap the top part of any screen, and a list of shortcuts will appear. You can go directly to the music player, toggle the Bluetooth connection on and off, set your ring and vibration profile, send a new text message, send a new mobile e-mail, check your voice mail, start the instant messenger for either Yahoo, AOL, or Windows Live, set your alarm clock, or view the calendar.

As with all touch-screen handsets, you use only your fingers (or a stylus if you have one) to navigate the interface. It felt quite intuitive, and we liked that there was haptic feedback to let us know when our touch has registered. There''s also Touch Calibration to ensure proper accuracy and responsiveness. Do note there''s a slight learning curve involved. When we first started using it, we occasionally had issues when scrolling through lists--sometimes we would accidentally select something by mistake. We did learn to deal with this eventually, though. Dialing numbers went pretty smoothly, because of the large numbers on the virtual keypad. There''s also a built-in internal accelerometer, but it only works with certain applications, like the Web browser--it would turn the screen orientation from portrait to landscape mode when tilted 90 degrees, for example.


The LG Xenon has a slide-out QWERTY keyboard.
To make texting easier, the LG Xenon has a slide-out QWERTY keyboard on the side. Just slide the phone to the right, and a full four-line QWERTY keyboard will appear on your left. When you slide the keyboard out, the screen orientation will change from portrait mode to landscape mode. We really like the keys on this keyboard--they''re well-spaced and feel very tactile, making it easy to type with speed. We especially like that there are specialized keys on the keyboard, like a dedicated text message key, a dedicated mobile e-mail key, a Web browser key, a phone book key, an @ symbol key, and a .com key. The latter two are especially useful when entering e-mail addresses, and of course the .com key is good for entering Web URLs. If you prefer not to use the keyboard, you can choose to enter in text via a virtual T9 keypad, but we see no reason to do so.

Underneath the display are the Call and End/Power keys, plus a task manager key that lets you switch between open applications. On the left spine is the volume rocker, the charger jack is on the top, and the right spine is home to the microSD card slot, the hold/screen lock key, and a dedicated camera button. On the back of the Xenon is the camera lens and LED flash. There''s no self-portrait mirror, however.

Features
The LG Xenon has a rather skimpy 500-entry phone book, with room in each entry for two phone numbers, an e-mail address, and a memo. You can assign contacts to caller groups, have a photo for caller ID, and one of 10 polyphonic ringtones or one of 10 message alert tones. Basic features include a vibrate mode, a speakerphone, text and multimedia messaging, a calendar, an alarm clock, a calculator, a voice recorder, voice command, a notepad, a world clock, a tasks list, a stopwatch, a tip calculator, and a unit converter.

More advanced users will like the stereo Bluetooth, instant messaging (with AIM, Yahoo, and Windows Live accounts), mobile e-mail, and A-GPS. The mobile e-mail is housed within a Web-based interface and will only support e-mail from certain accounts like Yahoo, AOL, AIM, Windows Live Hotmail, AT&T Yahoo, BellSouth, Comcast, Earthlink, Juno, Mindspring, and NetZero. We weren''t able to use Gmail, especially since the Xenon doesn''t support POP or IMAP. As for A-GPS, the Xenon comes with AT&T Navigator, AT&T''s turn-by-turn location-based service.

As with most touch-screen phones, we expect there to be a full HTML browser to make use of the larger screen real estate, and on that point, we''re not disappointed. We also like that you can open up multiple browser windows, which act like tabbed browsing. Like on a regular browser, you can change the font size, toggle pop-up windows, turn off images, and more. However, the Media Net browser on the Xenon proved to be clunkier than we would like. Even though it renders most pages just fine, it sometimes won''t load CSS designs properly and the page would look a little strange. You have to zoom in and out of pages using the little magnifying glass icon, which can be a bit tedious after a while, as there was often a lag. Also, because the screen is so small, you''ll have to scroll a lot more through pages. Thankfully, the arrows on the QWERTY keyboard make this easier.

Since the Xenon comes with 3G/HSDPA, it is compatible with AT&T''s array of broadband services, which include AT&T''s Cellular Video, which lets you watch streaming video clips from content providers like CNN and CBS, AT&T Video Share, which lets you make one-way video calls to another Video Share-compatible phone, and of course AT&T Mobile Music, a music portal with an online music store, courtesy of Napster. Also in the AT&T Mobile Music offering is XM Radio Mobile, a streaming service for satellite radio subscribers, Music ID, a song ID service, music videos courtesy of MobiVJ, a music fan community, and a ringtone maker.

AT&T Mobile Music also houses the music player. It has a pretty generic interface, found on most AT&T music phones. It does have the typical music player controls like repeat and shuffle mode, and the ability to create and edit playlists. You can transfer songs via a USB cable, or purchase them over-the-air via the aforementioned Napster. It supports MP3, AAC, AAC+, and WMA formats. It has a built-in 80MB of memory, but there''s a microSD card slot in case you want additional storage.


The LG Xenon takes pretty good photos.
You can also store photos on the microSD card, which is useful, since the Xenon has a 2-megapixel camera. You can take pictures in four different resolutions (1,600x1,200, 1,280x960, 640x480, 320x240), three quality settings, five color effects, and five white balance presets. Other settings include a night mode, a timer, brightness, a flash toggle, and the choice of three shutter tones plus a silent option. The photo quality is pretty good. Colors did look a little muted, but the image looks tack sharp. There''s also a camcorder that can record in two resolutions (320x240 and 176x144) with similar options to the still camera. You can record in three modes; General mode, which just takes up however much memory you have, MMS, which is a shorter video clip, and Video Share, which is the one-way video calling service we mentioned earlier.

You can personalize the LG Xenon with a variety of wallpaper, color schemes, clock and calendar formats, alert tones, and more. The LG Xenon comes with a few applications like MobiTV, which lets you watch live streaming TV, Mobile Banking, and My-Cast Weather. There are also games like Bubble Bash, Diner Dash 2, I-play Bowling, and Monopoly Here & Now. You can always download more personalization options, applications, and games from the Media Net store.

Performance
We tested the quad-band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) LG Xenon in San Francisco using AT&T''s service. Call quality was very impressive. Callers could hardly hear any static or background noise, though they could still tell we were on a cell phone due to the slightly robotic quality to our voice. On our end, we did hear a bit of static and echo, which were amplified when we turned on the speakerphone. It wasn''t too bad, but still noticeable.

Speaking of speakerphones, callers thought we sounded just fine over speakerphone. They did report a bit of an echo effect, but that''s normal. On our end, the sound from the speakers was a bit hollow, but we could still hear them just fine. The speakers definitely don''t do the music justice, though, as the audio sounded tinny and hollow. We definitely recommend using a stereo headset instead.

We were mostly impressed with the 3G speeds, though we think it could be a little faster. Loading a complex Web page like CNET.com took around a minute and a half, though simpler Web pages loaded much faster. Buffering video from AT&T''s Cellular Video took about 30 seconds as well, though there was no rebuffering after the video started playing. Video quality did appear pixelated, but that''s more on AT&T''s end than the fault of the phone.

The LG Xenon has a rated battery life of four hours talk time and 11 days in standby time. According to the FCC, the LG Xenon has a digital SAR rating of 0.686 watt per kilogram.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:45' WHERE "id" = 67[0m

Nokia 6500 Classic
The Nokia 6500 Classic is just what you''d expect from a Nokia phone. It offers a sturdy candy-bar design, a simple interface, a functional midrange feature set, and acceptable call quality. It''s not flashy by any means, but it gets the job done as a communication device. Indeed, our only real complaints centered on the cramped keypad, the lack of a dedicated volume rocker, and the average photo quality. The 6500 Classic isn''t offered by a U.S. carrier, but you can get it unlocked for just $279 from online retailers like Expansys.com.

Design
The 6500 blends classic Nokia design with current styles. On one hand, it has a basic candy-bar shape with a durable metal skin. The phone feels great in the hand and we didn''t worry about the occasional drop to the floor. On the other hand, it''s got a thin profile. Nokia never jumped into the slim handset craze very deeply, but the effect works well here. At 4.32 inches tall by 1.77 inches wide by inches 0.37 inch deep, and weighing 3.31 ounces, the 6500 travels well.

The 2-inch display supports 16.7 million colors and 320x240 pixels. With such a high resolution, you can be sure that colors are bright and photos and graphics are sharp and vibrant. You can set the font color and size, but other options, like the brightness and backlighting time, are not customizable. The Series 40 fifth-edition menus are intuitive and easy to use.

The spacious navigation array consists of a tactile toggle with a central OK button, two soft keys, and the Talk and End/power buttons. We had no trouble using the controls, though we''d prefer a dedicated speakerphone button and a back key. You can set the toggle as a shortcut to four user-defined functions, and you can activate shortcut icons on the display.

The keypad buttons were rather cramped, actually. Though they''re tactile thanks to silver ridges, the black keys may be too small for users with large hands. What''s more, the backlit numbers and letters on the keys are tiny. Users with visual impairments should definitely test this phone before buying. We fumbled at first when trying to dial and text quickly.

We were also disappointed that the 6500 Classic didn''t have a dedicated volume rocker on its side. That means you have to control the audio with the toggle when you''re on a call, which is rather inconvenient. The only other exterior features are the camera lens and flash, on the phone''s back side, and a micro-USB port on the top end. Since the latter is also used for the charger and the included wired headset, you can use only one peripheral at a time and you must have an adapter to use your own headset.

Features
Each contact in the 6500 Classic''s phone book holds five phone numbers, an e-mail address, a URL, a company name and job title, a formal name and nickname, a birthday, a street address, and notes (the SIM card holds an additional 250 names). You can save callers to groups and you can pair them with one of 26 available 64-chord polyphonic ringtones. You also can pair contacts with a photo or video for caller ID.

Other 6500 Classic essentials include text and multimedia messaging, a vibrate mode, an alarm clock, a calendar, a to-do list, a notepad, a calculator, a speaker phone, a world clock, a voice recorder, a countdown timer, and a stopwatch. Higher-end options are respectable; you''ll find stereo Bluetooth, voice commands, audio messaging, USB mass storage, an internal-search app, PC syncing, a currency and unit converter, and Web-based e-mail. The 6500 also supports Yahoo Go, for direct access to e-mail and Yahoo content, and it is equipped for 850 and 2100 3G (UMTS) bands. If your carrier supports the service, you can watch streaming video on the 6500.


The 6500 has a bright flash.
The 2-megapixel camera takes JPEG pictures in seven resolutions, from 1,600x1,200 down to 160x120. Other editing options include three quality settings, a self-timer, a digital zoom, a multishot mode, a night mode, five color effects, and an adjustable white balance. There''s also a flash, which you can set to "always on," "always off," and auto modes. The camcorder shoots MPEG4 clips in two resolutions (176x144 and 128x96) and three quality settings. Clips meant for multimedia messages are capped at 10 seconds, but you can shoot for longer in normal mode.


The 6500 offers average photo quality.
The 6500 Classic had decent photo quality, though we''d expect better from a 2-megapixel shooter. Colors were bright, but images were grainy, with a lot of noise. What''s more, the flash tends to drown things out. Videos were about the same: good but not great. On the upside, the 6500 offers 1GB of internal storage. It doesn''t have an external memory card slot, but you shouldn''t really need one.

The music player on the 6500 is functional. Features include playlists, shuffle and repeat modes, stereo widening, and an equalizer with four settings and two customizable settings. The interface is simple and intuitive and you can choose from four themes. Getting music on the phone was easy. You can transfer tracks via a USB cable or Bluetooth. You also can play songs on a speaker or stereo headset via Bluetooth. The player supports MP3, MP4, eAAC+, AAC, and WMA files.

You can personalize the 6500 with a variety of screensavers, wallpapers, themes, and alert tones. You can download additional options and more ringtones with the Opera Mini browser. Gamers can select from four titles: Backgammon, Golf Tour, Snake III, and Sudoku. You can buy additional games if you wish.

Performance
We tested the quad-band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) Nokia 6500 Classic in San Francisco using T-Mobile service. Call quality was quite good on the whole. Conversations were loud and clear and voices sounded natural. We could hear well even when we were in noisy environments, and the signal was relatively strong and had no static or interference. Our only complaint is that we had to use the toggle to change the volume level.

On their end, callers said we sounded fine; a few couldn''t even tell that we were using a cell phone. A couple of our friends mentioned a fair amount of wind noise, but they said it was a minor problem. We encountered no issues when speaking to automated-calling systems. Speaker-phone calls were quite decent: we had enough volume on our end and the sound wasn''t muffled. Callers could hear us, provided we spoke relatively close to the phone.

As mentioned previously, the 6500 accommodates both the 850 and 2100 UMTS 3G bands. That means that you''ll be able to get a wireless broadband connection both in North America and Europe. Yet, since T-Mobile uses its own AWS 3G network, we weren''t able to test the 6500''s 3G connection. The GPRS and EDGE coverage was satisfactory, however.

The 6500''s music quality was satisfactory. Like most music phones, the external speaker is a tad tinny and the audio lacks warmth. We recommend using a headset for the best experience.

The 6500 has a rated battery life of 3.5 hours talk time and nine days standby time. In our tests, the 6500 lasted 4 hours and 3 minutes of talk time on a single charge. According to FCC radiation tests, the 6500 has a digital SAR rating of 1.20 watts per kilogram.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:45' WHERE "id" = 70[0m

Motorola i9 Stature
In the back of our minds we knew that the Motorola Razr, at least in some form, would make it to Sprint Nextel. Though the original Razr V3 is more than five years old, and Motorola has pumped out dozens of revamps, it has made it to every other carrier. And even though Nextel tends to shy away from thin, flashy devices, we just couldn''t believe that Moto would pass up the opportunity to make an iDEN Razr. While the cell phone in question, the Motorola i9 Stature, does not carry the Razr name, it bears all the hallmarks of the venerable handset. Its thin, boxy profile takes us back to the V3, while the glossy skin, expansive external display, touch controls, and flat keypad remind us of the Razr2 V9m series.

Remarkably, the i9''s feature set doesn''t improve very much upon recent Razr models, but it remains a solid midrange model for communication and multimedia. It offers push-to-talk, a 3.1-megapixel camera, Bluetooth, and a music player. Call quality was decent--voices sounded a bit robotic, but we could carry on a conversation without any real problems. Besides Nextel, you also can get the i9 with Boost Mobile. The Nextel price is $199 with a contract, while contract-free Boost charges $299.

Design
As we mentioned already, the i9 is another branch of the Razr family tree. Yet, while the styling is old, the trade-off is that it is one of the most stylish Nextel phones ever. Razr fans, if there are any left, would recognize the sleek lines and trim, angular design. At 4.1 inches tall by 2.1 inches wide by 0.59 inches thick, it slips right into a pocket or bag, so it''s easy to take on the go. And though it''s a tad heavy at 4.7 ounces, it also has a sturdy and comfortable feel in the hand. We liked the soft touch material and the shiny front face, even if the latter shows fingerprints and smudges.

The 262,000-color external display is large and vibrant (two inches, 320x240 pixels). Colors are bright and graphics are sharp, provided you can see through the aforementioned smudges. It shows the date, time, battery life, signal strength, and numeric caller ID. It also shows photo caller ID and it works as a viewfinder for the camera lens. What''s more, you can navigate through the i9s full menu structure and all applications without ever opening the phone. You can add wallpaper, but the short backlighting time isn''t adjustable. You can always light it again, however, by pressing the volume rocker.

Like the V9, the i9 has touch music controls on its front face, but they''re not part of the external display. Instead, they''re set into the mirrored frame surrounding the display. Like most touch controls, the keys are slippery, but they''re easy to use and they have vibrating feedback. Besides the play/pause, skip, and rewind buttons, you also can cycle through different player views. You even can delete music files thanks to a Trash control.

Other touch controls come into play depending on which feature you''re using. For example, when in video mode, new player controls will appear on the left side of the display (or on the bottom if you''re watching videos in landscape mode). And when you''re snapping photos, even more touch controls appear to let you manipulate the shooter. The concept is similar to the ModeShift keypad on the Motorola Rokr E8 in that the controls appear only when you need them. Otherwise, they''ll vanish to avoid a cluttered look.

As for physical exterior controls, the i9 has a few. On the left spine you''ll find a volume rocker, the PTT button, a speakerphone/voice-dialing control, and the Micro-USB/charger port, while a handset locking switch, a camera shutter, and a control for activating the menu on the external display are on the right. The microSD card slot sits behind the battery cover. That''s not the most convenient location, even if you don''t have to remove the battery. We also didn''t love the location of the camera lens and flash on the top left corner of the i9''s rear face. Not only is it a natural place to rest your finger, but also it makes vanity shots difficult.

The internal display has the same size and resolution as the external display. Yet, you can change more options, including the text size and backlighting time. Three menu designs are available--list, tab and icon--but all are relatively easy to use. Our only complaint was that it takes a few too many clicks to perform such basic functions, such as shooting a picture and sending it in a multimedia message. Also, if you exit out of submenus you go back to standby mode rather than reverting one step to the main menu.

Like with most Razr phones, the i9''s controls are hit and miss. Though they''re spacious, they''re also flush and rather stiff. Tiny silver bumps, similar to those on the Rokr E8, give the controls some tactile definition, but it''s not enough to dial by feel. The navigation array consists of a four-way toggle with a central OK button, two soft keys, a dedicated menu control, the Talk and End power keys, and a Web browser shortcut. That''s not a bad design, but we''d prefer a dedicated back key. In standby mode, the OK button will open the settings menu while the toggle doubles as a shortcut to four user-defined functions. The backlit keypad buttons are also spacious, but flat and stiff as well.

Features
The i9''s 600-contact phone book has room in each entry for seven phone numbers, an e-mail address, and notes. You can save contacts to groups or PTT Talk Groups and you can pair them with a photo and one of 28 polyphonic ringtones. Other basic features include a vibrate mode, text and multimedia messaging, a memo pad, a speakerphone, call timers, an alarm clock, and a datebook.

The i9 also has a few higher-end features: stereo Bluetooth, voice dialing and commands, an application manager, USB mass storage, PC syncing, access to Sprint Mobile e-mail, and a voice recorder. There''s also a GPS application, but it''s used for finding your position by longitude and latitude rather than by mapping or directional services.

As a Nextel phone, the i9 offers all of the carrier''s Direct Connect PTT services, including International Direct Connect, Group Connect (for chatting with up to 20 others via PTT at once), and Direct Talk (for out-of-network PTT-chat capabilities). You''ll also find NextMail, which sends voice messages to any e-mail address, and Direct Send, which transmits your contact information to other compatible phones. And finally, there''s Nextel''s second-line service, which lets you add a second line to the phone with a different phone number.


The i9''s camera has a flash, but the lens is in an inconvenient location.
The 3.1-megapixel camera takes photos in seven resolutions, from 2,048x1,536 down to 320x240. Other editing options include two quality settings, explore control, white balance, brightness, an 8x digital zoom, a self-timer, a macro mode, an autofocus, four color tones, and two shutter sounds (there''s no silent option). The camcorder shoots clips in three resolutions and it offers a similar set of editing options. Clips meant for multimedia messages are capped at six seconds, but you can shoot for longer in normal mode.


The i9''s photo quality was just average.
Photo quality wasn''t as good as we were hoping it would be. Most images were blurry and dark,with faded colors. Videos were about average--fine for a short clip, but quick movements came out choppy. We also noticed that the camera is a tad slow, and we didn''t like having to save every photo we took manually. The i9 has an impressive 128MB of internal memory and the microSD slot can accommodate cards up to 8GB.

The music player has simple interface on both displays. It supports album art and you can choose between a number of themes and visualizations. Features are pretty slim: you get shuffle and repeat modes and an equalizer with nine settings. Getting music on the phone is easy through either a USB cable, Bluetooth, or a memory card.

You can personalize the i9 with a variety of clock styles and wallpapers. You can download more options and additional ringtones with the wireless Web browser. You won''t find any games, but the Sprint version of the phone comes with the Nascar Sprint Cup Mobile application.

Performance
We tested the Motorola i9 Stature (iDEN 800) in San Francisco using Nextel service. Call quality was up to usual Nextel standards. The signal was clear and free of static and we had enough volume. Voices sounded natural most of the time, but there was a robotic effect at times. It wasn''t enough to be distracting, but it was noticeable.

On their end, callers said we sounded good. A few couldn''t even tell that we were using a cell phone. A couple people even remarked on the clarity of the call. Our friends could hear us when we were in noisy environments and we had no issues with automated calling systems. Speakerphone calls were quite satisfying, with loud and clear conversations on both ends.

The i9 has a rated battery life of three hours talk time. Our tests showed a talk time of 5 hours and 38 minutes. According to FCC radiation tests, the i9 has a digital SAR rating of 1.44 watts per kilogram.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:45' WHERE "id" = 73[0m

CNET editors'' review

Most of the recent LG phones from AT&T have either been fancy touch-screen handsets (like the LG Incite) or slim models that can stream live TV (The LG Invision, for example). The LG CF360, on the other hand, takes the midtier approach, much like the LG Shine of two years ago. The CF360 is a slim slider that is easy on the eyes and the hands, and while its feature set isn''t that exciting, it''s not that bad either. The LG CF360 is available for a very affordable $29.99 after a two-year service agreement and a $50 mail-in rebate.

Design
The LG CF360 has a simple slim slider design, and though it looks quite ordinary, we like it all the same. Measuring 3.97 inches long by 1.89 inches wide by 0.66 inch thick, the CF360 is wrapped in a soft-touch black surface that gives the phone a nice grip and makes it feel comfortable in the hand. The slider mechanism feels solid, and requires a firm push to slide up or down. You can get the CF360 with either a blue or red stripe along its sides. The navigation keys are either blue or red as well. The CF360 weighs about 3.5 ounces, which won''t weigh you down.


The LG CF360 has a slider design.
On the front of the phone is the 2-inch QVGA display with support for 65,000 colors and a 240x320-pixel resolution. Though it doesn''t have support for 262,000 colors like we would prefer, the display still looks colorful and images look quite sharp. You can adjust the font size, the color of the dialing font, the screen''s brightness, backlight timer, color schemes, and the menu style.

The navigation array consists of two soft keys, four directional keys, a middle OK key, a Call and End/Power key, plus the Clear/Back key. The four directional keys are raised above the surface, while the other keys are a bit flusher to the surface. Slide the phone open and you''ll find the number keypad. The keypad is roomy, and though the keys are not as tactile as we would like, there are still enough delineations between each key so it''s easy to dial and text. All the keys have a nice give to them.


The LG CF360 has a 1.3-megapixel camera lens on the back.
The volume rocker is on the left spine, while the microSD card slot is on the top. On the right spine are a dedicated camera key, a task menu key, and the charger/headset jack. The task menu key lets you tab between open applications. On the back of the CF360 are a camera lens and a speaker grille. There''s no self-portrait mirror or flash, though.

Features
The LG CF360 has a generous 1,000-entry phone book with room in each entry for two phone numbers, an e-mail address, and a memo. You can assign contacts to caller groups, a photo for caller ID, and one of 20 polyphonic ringtones. Other basic features include a vibrate mode, a speakerphone, text and multimedia messaging, an alarm clock, a notepad, a calendar, a calculator, a world clock, a tasks list, a stopwatch, a tip calculator, and a unit converter. Slightly advanced features include voice command and voice dialing support, a wireless Web browser, a voice recorder, instant messaging (AIM, Windows Live, and Yahoo Messenger), stereo Bluetooth, and mobile e-mail. The mobile e-mail is limited--it only supports Web-based e-mail like Hotmail and Yahoo Mail, plus a few select ISPs like Comcast and Earthlink. The CF360 also has A-GPS, and it comes with AT&T Navigator, AT&T''s turn-by-turn location-based service.

Since the CF360 has 3G/HSDPA support, it is compatible with AT&T''s array of broadband services. They include AT&T''s Cellular Video, which lets you watch streaming video clips from sources like CNN and CBS, AT&T Video Share, which lets you stream live one-way video to another Video-Share-compatible phone, plus AT&T Mobile Music, a music portal with an online music store courtesy of Napster. You can also download applications like MobiTV, which lets you watch live TV.

The music player is housed within the AT&T Mobile Music menu. It has a very plain interface, with the typical music player controls, a repeat and shuffle mode, and the capability to create and edit playlists on the fly. The music player supports MP3, AMR-NB, AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, and WMA files, and you can transfer songs via a USB cable just by dragging and dropping or just purchase them over-the-air via the aforementioned Napster music store. AT&T Mobile Music also offers XM Radio Mobile, which will stream satellite radio provided you have an existing account, Music ID, a song identification service, and access to music news, plus a music fan community. You can also watch streaming music videos and shop for ringtones.


The LG CF360''s camera takes mediocre photos.
The LG CF360 comes with a 1.3-megapixel camera. Photo quality is mediocre, with blurry images and overcast colors. You can take pictures in four resolutions (1,280x960, 640x480, 320x240, 160x120), three quality settings, 11 color effects, and five white balance presets. Other settings include brightness, a night mode, a self-timer, and three shutter tones plus a silent option. There''s also a video recorder. You can record video clips in two sizes (320x240 and 176x144) with settings similar to the still camera''s settings.

You can personalize the CF360 with a variety of wallpaper, color schemes, clock and calendar formats, alert tones, and more. The CF360 comes with a few applications like MobiTV, Mobile Banking, MobilePix, and WikiMobile, plus games like Block Breaker Deluxe, Ms. Pac-Man, and Tetris. You can download more options from the CF360''s MediaNet browser.

Performance
We tested the quad-band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) LG CF360 in San Francisco using AT&T''s service. Call quality was very good. Callers could hardly hear any static or background noise, though they could still tell we were on a cell phone. We could hear them loud and clear as well. Speakerphone calls were a little lower in quality. They said we sounded a little muffled, and we thought the sound from the speakers was a bit hollow and tinny. Still, we could hear each other just fine.

As for audio quality, the small external speaker on the CF360 doesn''t do the songs justice. The bass is weak, and as we said, it was a bit tinny. We would recommend using a headset for better quality. The video quality from AT&T''s Cellular Video wasn''t great, with a lot of pixelation. That said, thanks to the 3G/HSDPA speed, there was hardly any buffering time. Simple WAP Web pages loaded quickly, and we downloaded a song in under a minute.

The LG CF360 has a rated battery life of three hours talk time and 10 days 10 hours standby time. According to the FCC, the LG CF360 has a digital SAR rating of 0.676 watt per kilogram.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:46' WHERE "id" = 76[0m

The phone will supposedly be an astounding 10.6mm thin, will measure just 55mm x 111mm (about 2.1 by 4.3-inches), weigh 100 grams, and will tout a 2.63-inch, 320 x 400 capacitive display. Of course, the info we''ve got right now can''t be verified, and since there are a couple of minor question marks here (like barely rounded corners in the OS), you should take it all with a grain of salt... as usual. Needless to say, we''re working on getting more details (and some confirmation), so stay tuned!

Update: Oh boy -- looks like we just got the full spec list. And yes, it''s definitely coming to AT&T (if it''s really coming).

Well, HTC is taking the concept to another level with its HTC Touch Cruise series by shipping the smartphone with full navigation software and maps. The first model debuted back in November 2007, but in January 2009, the smartphone manufacturer unveiled a revamped version of the HTC Touch Cruise, complete with an updated, and thankfully, slimmer design, and new geotagging software called HTC Footprints. The North American version of the Touch Cruise also ships with U.S. maps and comes with CoPilot Live navigation software, which includes your standard turn-by-turn voice directions, points of interest, and other useful extras.

The Touch Cruise proved to be a reliable navigator, and the Footprints app provides a great way to document and share your travels. As a smartphone, it was middle of the road, offering plenty of features but coming with the typical Windows Mobile sluggishness. The Touch Cruise definitely isn''t for everyone; it will be most useful to those who travel a lot, either for work and play, and want to minimize the gadgets they carry on the road. The HTC Touch Cruise is available unlocked for around $500, which is pricey. However, remember that for the price, you''re getting maps and full navigation features and won''t be required to pay a monthly subscription fee to use them.

Design
The revamped HTC Touch Cruise thankfully sheds some of the weight and bulk of its predecessor. The smartphone is much more manageable and pocketable at 4 inches tall by 2.1 inches wide by 0.5 inch thick and 3.6 ounces (compared to 4.3 inches by 2.2 inches by 0.6 inch and 4.5 ounces). While being incredibly light, the handset has a solid construction and feels comfortable to hold as a phone or as a handheld navigation device and comes with a soft finish on the back. In addition, the Touch Cruise is a more attractive handset with its updated look and rounder edges.


The HTC Touch Cruise is much more compact and attractive than its predecessor.
Despite the smaller design, there weren''t any sacrifices made to the screen size, which still comes in at 2.8 inches. The touch screen shows 65,000 colors at a 320x240-pixel resolution. While clear and bright, it''s not as sharp as some other smartphones we''ve seen, such as the HTC Touch Diamond. Also, the screen tends to wash out in bright sunlight, which is common with most cell phones, but it posed a problem when using the Touch Cruise as an in-car navigation system since we couldn''t see the maps very well. The smaller display size doesn''t help, either, but this is mitigated in part by the voice-guided directions. Still, the Touch Cruise is better suited as a handheld GPS.

As part of the Touch series, the Cruise uses HTC''s TouchFlo 3D interface that presents an aesthetically pleasing and easier way to access your information and applications. A toolbar along the bottom of the screen allows you to scroll through and launch applications, such as your e-mail, contacts, Web browser, and multimedia. As a GPS-centric phone, the Touch Cruise also adds tabs for the HTC Footprints geotagging app and Map Search.

Like HTC''s other Touch devices, the Cruise offers several methods for text entry. You can choose from a QWERTY, a compact QWERTY, a phone keypad, Block Recognizer, and more. Most of the time, we used the full QWERTY mode but even then, we found it to be quite cramped. We couldn''t type messages with just our thumbs, so we often had to use the stylus, which slowed us down. We encountered the same problem while entering destinations into CoPilot.


The Touch Cruise''s navigation controls include shortcuts to the device''s GPS apps, Talk and End keys, and a navigation wheel.
Below the display, you get a navigation array of Talk and End keys, shortcuts to the CoPilot and Footprints, and a navigation wheel with a center select button. The wheel is similar to the one on the original Touch Cruise; in addition to pressing it up, down, left, and right, you can rotate the wheel clockwise or counterclockwise to move through the menu items. It provided fairly good control, even though the wheel felt quite loose.

On the left spine, there''s a volume rocker, but it''s quite thin and a little difficult to use when you''re on a call and need to adjust the sound. The camera is located on the back, and behind the battery cover, you''ll find the microSD expansion slot. Finally, there''s a reset hole and a mini USB port on the bottom that also serves as the power connector and headset jack. We''ve said it before, but we''ll say it again; the use of a nonstandard headset jack is quite annoying, and we hope HTC moves to a standard 3.5mm jack on future devices.

The HTC Touch Cruise comes packaged with a healthy amount of accessories, including an AC adapter, a USB cable, a 2GB microSD card preloaded with maps, a wired headset, a protective pouch, a vehicle mount, a software CD, and reference material. For more add-ons, please check our cell phone accessories, ringtones, and help page.

Features
The HTC Touch Cruise continues to run Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional Edition, so you get the same productivity suite and e-mailing capabilities as well as some extras, including the Opera mobile Web browser, a dedicated YouTube app, and MP3 Trimmer for creating your own ringtones.

The biggest draw, of course: the built-in GPS and navigation abilities. The North American version of the Touch Cruise uses CoPilot Live for turn-by-turn guidance instead of TomTom''s navigation software, which is still available on the European version. While we''ve experienced ease of use and accuracy from TomTom, CoPilot is no slouch in the navigation department, and in fact, it offers a couple of helpful extras.

CoPilot Live''s user interface is intuitive and attractive. The menu pages offer large icons with clear identification, so most users should be able to pick up the device and start navigating right away. The application offers text- and voice-guided directions as well as 2D and 3D map views, day and night map colors, detour routing, and support for multi-destination trips. It includes a fairly comprehensive points-of-interest database, including all the major categories and more specialized interests (e.g., event facilities and marinas). In addition, you can conduct local searches. For example, you can simply type in "pizza," and the app will look for pizza places close to your location. You can also do this with the Map Search tab on the TouchFlo interface without having to launch CoPilot.

The aforementioned extras include weather updates for your current location, destination or any U.S. city. You can also let your friends and family know where you are with a Send Location feature that will send a text message of your location or destination and ETA to said destination.

As we noted in the Design section, HTC ships the Touch Cruise with a 2GB microSD card that include U.S. maps. This is great, since the first model only offered one city map for free and required you to purchase additional regions. The one trade-off is that this restricts your expandable memory. With all the maps, you only get about 846MB of user-accessible storage on the memory card. You can always switch out memory cards when you''re not using the navigation features, but it''s still a bit annoying. Onboard memory is 512MB ROM and 256MB RAM.


The smartphone''s expansion slot is located behind the battery cover. HTC ships the Touch Cruise is a 2GB microSD card preloaded with U.S. maps.
To expand on the GPS capabilities, HTC also added a new app called Footprints. The application not only lets you geotag photos that you take using the device''s 3.2-megapixel camera, but you can also add notes and audio clips to these digital "postcards." In addition, Footprints will automatically name each postcard with its general location or area, so you have all the information as you flip through the images at a later time. You can also plot a saved location to Google Maps and then navigate to it by pressing the navigation key.

The Touch Cruise''s 3.2-megapixel camera did an OK job with capturing locations and other images. You get all the standard camera options, including different picture qualities, white balance and brightness controls, effects, and more. The camera also offers video recording capabilities.


Without a dedicated camera button, we had a hard time capturing clear photos.
There''s no flash but by adjusting the white balance, we were able to get pretty good coloring in our pictures. Our biggest complaint is that it''s hard to get a steady shot. Without a dedicated capture button on the outer spine of the smartphone, we had to use the center select key or the onscreen capture button and this caused a bit of movement while taking the picture, so we often ended up with blurry shots.

Switching gears to voice features, the HTC Touch Cruise offers quad-band world roaming, a speakerphone, speed dial, smart dialing, voice commands, three-way calling, and text and multimedia messaging. The address book is only limited by the available memory, and each entry can store multiple numbers, home and work addresses, e-mail, IM screen name, birthday, spouse''s name, and more. For caller ID purposes, you can pair a contact with a photo, a caller group, or a custom ringtone. Bluetooth 2.0 is also onboard for use with support for mono and stereo Bluetooth headsets, hands-free kits, object push, file transfer, and dial-up networking.

The Touch Cruise is 3G-capable, supporting AT&T''s HSDPA 850/1900MHz bands, while T-Mobile users will be left to EDGE since the carrier''s 3G network runs on the 1700/2100MHz bands. The smartphone does have integrated Wi-Fi, however, so that provides an alternative.

Performance
We tested the quad-band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) HTC Touch Cruise in San Francisco using AT&T service and call quality was decent. Initially, we had problems dialing out but that was more of an AT&T network issue as we only had one bar of service. For the most part, conversations sounded clear but there were a couple of occasions where the audio would cut in and out. Meanwhile, friends didn''t report any major issues. We also had no problem using an airline''s voice-automated response system. Speakerphone quality wasn''t the greatest, since the volume was a bit low, even at its highest level, so we had a hard time hearing our callers in noisier environments. We were able to pair the Touch Cruise with the Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth headset and the Motorola S9 Bluetooth Active Headphones.

The Touch Cruise is equipped with a 528HHz Qualcomm MSM7225 processor, but we experienced a bit of the typical Windows Mobile sluggishness--no better, no worse than most. We saw couple-second delays when trying to open pictures or e-mails, which doesn''t seem like a lot. However, there were times where we''d tap an image or message, and there''d be a long enough delay where we questioned if the smartphone even registered our command. That said, we didn''t experience any significant delays or system crashes during our test period.

The Touch Cruise shines where it counts most--navigation. We used CoPilot Live to plot a course from CNET''s downtown office in San Francisco to the Marina District. From a cold start, it took the smartphone about 3 minutes for it to find our location, and then it was then able to quickly calculate a route based on the fastest preference. We set out on our journey, and the Touch Cruise did a good job of tracking our location. It would be nice if the voice prompts were a smidge louder (we had it at the highest volume) and text-to-speech directions were supported, which announces specific street names instead of more generic directions, especially since the smaller screen size made us rely on the audible prompts more.

We also purposefully missed a couple of routes along the way to test the route recalculation rate. CoPilot Live was very fast to get us back on track, but we didn''t always know it. The app didn''t provide any audible notification that it was rerouting us, so we weren''t sure initially if it even realized we were off route. Still, we followed along and the Touch Cruise was able to get us to our destination with no problem. The local search and Send Location features also worked flawlessly. HTC Footprints also worked as advertised. More useful to leisurely travel, it''s really a nice way to document highlights of your trip for later reference or for sharing with friends and family.

The HTC Touch Cruise features a 1,100mAh lithium ion battery with a rated talk time of 6.6 hours (GSM)/6.25 hours (3G) and up to 13 days (GSM)/16 days (3G) of standby time.

"The latest Samsung Trance, for example, had its sound technology developed by Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen, a high-end audio equipment brand, which results in an array of equalizer modes and 3D sound effects. The result is simply fantastic audio quality; definitely one of the better MP3 phones we''ve tried." CNET Review </br>



While a lot of phones have integrated music players, few handsets qualify as bonafide MP3 phones. Not only do they have much better audio quality than most, but also they usually boast a few features that focus specifically on enhancing the music experience. The latest Samsung Trance, for example, had its sound technology developed by Bang &amp;amp;amp; Olufsen, a high-end audio equipment brand, which results in an array of equalizer modes and 3D sound effects. The result is simply fantastic audio quality; definitely one of the better MP3 phones we''ve tried. We''re not too pleased with the lack of EV-DO and that you can''t download music over-the-air from Verizon Wireless'' V Cast. Still, the Trance is a very stylish handset with great performance, and for that we think the $49.99 price, with a two-year service agreement, is very reasonable.

Design
The Samsung Trance is an undeniably stylish handset, with an elegant design that any fashionista would love. Measuring 4 inches long by 1.97 inches wide by 0.55 inch thick, the Trance has a slim profile, rounded corners, and a beautiful glossy finish. The front of the Trance is ever so slightly curved in the shape of a violin, which adds to the visual appeal. The front surface is also very reflective, which makes it fingerprint prone and a little hard to read the display under bright sunlight. The Trance is lightweight at only 3.53 ounces.


The Samsung Trance has a beautiful design.
On the front of the Trance is the 2.1-inch screen with support for 262,000 TFT color and 176x229-pixel resolution. The display is gorgeous, with bold colors and a resolution that show off the drop-shadow effect on the icons. You can adjust the backlight time for the screen and the keypad, the display themes, the style and size of the dial and menu fonts, the clock format on the standby page, and the menu layout. You can even replace and reposition menu items.

Underneath the display is the touch-sensitive navigation array. When idle, the entire array appears black and empty. When the phone is active, the array lights up with the two soft keys, the four-way toggle with middle OK key, a dedicated music player key, and the Cancel key. The music player key activates the music player of course, but when the music player is already active, it brings up the song playlist. The four-way toggle corresponds to three user-defined shortcuts for the up, left, and down directions, and the right direction leads to a My Shortcuts dialog box. The My Shortcuts box can also be customized with up to four of your favorite shortcuts.


The Samsung Trance has a touch-sensitive navigation array.
The navigation array is completely flat with the surface, and you have to rely on the keys vibration feedback to get a feel for them. You can adjust the touch vibration settings and the sensitivity level. When the phone is closed, you won''t be able to use the array until you unlock it with the hold/keypad lock key on the side. While we understand this touchpad provides a very sleek look to the Trance, we still would prefer physical keys for easier navigation.

Slide the phone up and you''ll reveal the number keypad with the Send, camera key, and Talk/End power keys on the top row. The overall keypad is quite flat to the surface, but there are little row dividers that help provide some texture when dialing and texting. But we would prefer a more tactile keypad.


The Samsung Trance has a 3.5-mm headset jack.
On the left side of the Trance are the volume rocker, the hold/keypad lock key, and the microSD card slot, and the charger jack, the speakerphone key, and a 3.5 millimeter headset jack. We''re definitely happy to see a 3.5 millimeter headset jack here, especially since the Trance touts itself as a music phone. The camera is only revealed when you slide the phone up--it''s on the back, next to a self-portrait mirror.

Features
The Samsung Trance has a 1,000-entry phone book with room in each entry for five numbers, two e-mail addresses, an IM screen name, a street address, and notes. You can save callers to groups, pair them with a photo for caller ID, or with one of 17 polyphonic ringtones for added customization. Basic features include a vibrate mode, a speakerphone, text and multimedia messaging, a calculator, an alarm clock, a calendar, a stop watch, a world clock, and a notepad. You also get voice command support, a wireless Web browser, mobile Web e-mail, USB mass storage mode, and location-based support for VZ Navigator and Verizon''s Chaperone service. Since it''s a music phone, we''re also pleased to see the Trance has stereo Bluetooth, plus a Music Sharing capability that lets you connect up to two stereo Bluetooth devices simultaneously.

As we said, the primary feature of the Trance is definitely the music player. The interface is simple and easy to use, with the album art in the center and the player controls underneath. You can view the music library, create and edit playlists, and set the songs on shuffle or repeat. Not only are there 11 preset equalizer settings, but there''s also a manual equalizer. The music player also has 3D sound, which you can only experience when a headset is plugged in. From there, you can choose Wide, Dynamic, or Surround sound. If you''re in an airplane, you can opt for Music Only mode, which shuts off the phone''s wireless signal and still lets you listen to your tunes.

Perhaps the most disappointing part of the music player is that the Trance does not have EV-DO. This means it doesn''t have access to Verizon''s broadband services like V Cast Music, so you can''t download songs over-the-air. You can get music on to the phone via the V Cast Music with Rhapsody application, but only by attaching a USB cable to your PC. Thankfully, the Trance has a whopping 1GB of internal memory, plus you can get up to a 16GB microSD card for more storage.


The Samsung Trance has a 1.3-megapixel camera on the back.
The Trance also comes with a 1.3-megapixel camera, but it''s nothing much to write home about. Photo quality is mediocre at best, with a lot of blurry images and muted colors. You can take pictures in six resolutions (1,280x960, 1,024x768, 640x480, 320x240, 160x120, 128x96), three quality settings, six color effects, and five white-balance presets. Other camera settings include spot or center metering, a night shot mode, a self-timer, a multishot mode, sound effects like the "ready sound" and the shutter sound (with silent options), brightness, and zoom.


The Samsung Trance has mediocre photo quality.
You can personalize the Trance with a variety of wallpaper and sounds plus you can get more graphics and tones from the WAP 2.0 wireless Web browser. The Trance doesn''t come with any games but you can download BREW-enabled titles from Verizon as well.

Performance
We tested the Samsung Trance in San Francisco using Verizon Wireless. We were very impressed with the call quality. Callers said we sounded loud and clear with very little hiss in the background. The voice quality was a tad machine-like but it was still very listenable. On our end, we heard them very clearly as well, with hardly any static at all. Call quality was similarly good on speakerphone mode, though callers sounded a bit hollower on the speakers.

But the real star of the show here is the audio quality. Thanks to the Bang &amp;amp;amp; Olufsen ICEPower technology, we were very impressed with the strong melody and bass in the songs. This was especially apparent when we turned on the Surround Sound mode. Overall, the audio sounded nice and full, and compares well with most dedicated MP3 players.

The Samsung Trace has a rated battery life life of 4.5 hours of talk time and 12.5 days in standby time. According to the FCC, it has a SAR rating of 1.34 watts per kilogram.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:46' WHERE "id" = 88[0m

"Even though the VX8360 may seem like any other clamshell, it actually comes with several high-end features that make it one of the better midtier handsets out there."


The LG VX8350 was one of our favorite Verizon Wireless phones in 2007 since it packed a lot of features into a simple and affordable package. Two years later, LG has released its successor, the VX8360. It''s not quite as rounded as the VX8350, but it still has that compact clamshell design down pat. Perhaps our only complaint is that its features are exactly the same as its predecessor (you still get the same 1.3-megapixel camera, for example). Also, there''s no reason to get the VX8360 if you already have an VX8350. But if you''re in the market for a midtier handset with EV-DO, decent multimedia features, and great call quality, the VX8360 fits the bill. At only $49.99 after a mail-in rebate and a two-year service agreement, it won''t hurt your wallet either.

Design
If you trimmed away the curves of the VX8350 and added more of a sporty flair, you would get the VX8360. Measuring 3.64 inches long by 1.91 inches wide by 0.78 inch thick, the VX8360 is a little smaller and thinner than its predecessor, while still maintaining the look and feel of a compact clamshell. It has a dark blue shell with silver trim and an inner chrome border, which result in quite a sporty racecar look. The VX8360 is also lightweight at 3.35 ounces and its slightly rounded edges make it feel comfortable in the hand.


The LG VX8360 has a sporty look.
On the front of the VX8360 is a small 1.17-inch diagonal color screen. It only supports 65,000 colors, but that''s OK since it''s only the external display. It shows the date, time, battery, and signal strength, caller ID, plus it has support for photo caller ID. It also acts as a self-portrait viewfinder when the camera is activated. When the music player is activated, you can see the album art and track information on it. Above the external display is the camera lens.

As with the VX8350, the VX8360 has external music player keys underneath the display, which we always like to see with music phones. The keys on the VX8360 are a lot flatter than the ones on the VX8350, but they are a little bigger and have slight delineations between the keys so it''s still possible to press by feel. Underneath the keys is a large speaker grille, which helps to improve the speaker volume. This is a noticeable improvement from the VX8350, which had the speaker on the back.


The LG VX8360 has a 1.3-megapixel camera.
Flip open the phone and you''ll find a very pleasant 2-inch diagonal main display. The 262,000 color support and 240x320-pixel resolution really help to make the screen pop with vibrant color and images. You can adjust the backlight time, the size and type of the fonts, the menu layout, and the clock format. Since we''re able to change out the menu layout, we can easily switch to a grid or list style, which is a little easier to navigate than the standard Verizon tabs interface.

We''re happy to see that the VX8360 has kept the easy-to-use keypad of its predecessor. The navigation keys and number keypad are well spaced, tactile, and have a nice bubbly raised texture that make it really easy to thumb-type text messages and dial by feel. The navigation array consists of two soft keys, a five-way toggle that doubles as shortcuts to four user-defined functions, a dedicated Speakerphone key, a dedicated messaging key, and the Send, Clear, and End/Power keys. The dedicated speakerphone key activates the speakerphone prior to a call, which we definitely like as well.

On the left spine of the VX8360 are a voice command key, the volume rocker, and the headset jack, while the right is home to the dedicated camera key and microSD card slot. The charger jack is on the bottom.

Features
Even though the VX8360 may seem like any other clamshell, it actually comes with several high-end features that make it one of the better midtier handsets out there. That said, its feature set is almost identical to that of the VX8350, and we wished there would be at least some improvement.

The LG VX8360 comes with a generous 1,000-entry phone book with room in each entry for five numbers and two e-mail addresses. You can organize your contacts into groups, pair them with a picture for photo caller ID, or one of 23 polyphonic ring tones and alert tones. Other essentials include a vibrate mode, a speakerphone, text and multimedia messaging, a calculator, a tip calculator, a calendar, an alarm clock, a stopwatch, a world clock, a notepad, and a voice memo recorder. More advanced users will like the mobile instant messaging (AIM, Yahoo, and MSN), mobile e-mail (this is done via the VX8360''s Web browser), voice command capabilities, a wireless Web browser, stereo Bluetooth, and USB Mass Storage mode. It also has A-GPS, and it is compatible with location-based services such as VZ Navigator and Chaperone, a Verizon service that helps parents keep track of their kids.

The VX8360 has EV-DO, and with that comes support for Verizon''s V Cast. That includes V Cast Video; Verizon''s streaming video service; plus V Cast Music with Rhapsody, Verizon''s music store. The VX8360''s music player is housed within Verizon''s V Cast Music interface, which is a little clunky, but still usable. The songs are grouped by genres, artists, and albums, plus you can create and edit your own playlists. Other player options include repeat and shuffle mode. You can purchase songs over the air for $1.99 each, which includes a simultaneous download to your PC. If you want, you can purchase songs directly from V Cast to your PC for only 99 cents. And if you have a Rhapsody music subscription ($14.99 a month), you can load some of your subscribed tracks directly to the phone. The VX8360 supports up to 8GB microSD cards, so that''s plenty of room for your MP3s.


The LG VX8360 has pretty good photo quality.
Like the VX8350, the VX8360 comes with a 1.3-megapixel camera. We''re a little disappointed that the VX8360''s camera did not at least get a slight megapixel update. That said, photo quality is pretty good for a 1.3-megapixel camera--images look sharp and saturated with color. Camera settings include three resolutions (1,280x960, 640x480, and 320x240), a self-timer, white balance, shutter sounds (with a silent option), color effects, brightness, a night mode, photometry/spot meter modes, plus the option to save the image to the phone''s internal memory or to a microSD card. The camera doesn''t have flash, however. As for the camcorder, there is only one video resolution of 176x144 pixels, and you can record in two lengths (up to 30 seconds for MMS or until the memory is full). Camcorder settings are similar to that of the still camera. Video quality is expectedly blurry and pixilated, but it''s OK for quick clips to share with your friends.

You can customize the VX8360 with a variety of wallpapers, display themes, ringtones, alerts, and more. The VX8360 doesn''t come with any games. If you want more options and applications, you can purchase and download them via the wireless Web browser.

Performance
We tested the LG VX8360 in San Francisco using the Verizon Wireless network. We were very impressed with the call quality. The VX8360 comes with "Voice Clarity" feature that helps to adjust the voice level based on the surrounding noise and, according to our callers, it worked. They could hear us loud and clear even in a variety of situations--in the office, in a crowded restaurant, and inside a car. On our end, we could hear them very clearly as well. Speakerphone quality was also slightly improved over the VX8350. Callers sounded loud and clear thanks to the speaker on the front, and they could hear us without any problems too.

Music quality is great as well. The bass is a little shallow, but overall sound quality was fine for a music phone. We would recommend using a headset for better audio fidelity.

As for the EV-DO speeds, we''re pleased that we''re able to surf the Web without a lot of waiting. We also downloaded a song in about 40 seconds, which is quite impressive. The streaming V Cast video looked a bit blurry, but there were no buffering issues.

The LG VX8360 has a rated battery life of 5.26 hours of talk time and 26.7 days of standby time. The tested talk time is a tad shorter at 4 hours and 22 minutes.

Motorola Renew W233
The story of T-Mobile''s Motorola Renew W233 lies not in what it offers--its features are quite minimal--but rather in what it is. Billed as the world''s first carbon neutral cell phone, the Renew is made entirely of recycled water bottles (at least the plastic parts) and it comes in packaging made from 100 percent recycled material. As such, the Renew goes far beyond the Nokia 3110, which is made from just 50 percent recycled plastic. Moto is also promising that with an estimated talk time of nine hours, the Renew will use less energy.

Though the idea of a green gadget may send some eyes rolling, other users might find comfort in the idea. In any case, the Renew isn''t a bad phone. Even with its minimal features and low-resolution display, it offers good call quality thanks to Moto''s CrystalTalk feature. It''s also a bargain, at just $9.99 with service.

Design
The Renew has a unique color scheme that fits perfectly with its Earth-friendly image. A lime green trim on three sides of the handset contrasts nicely with the cream keypad and black rear cover. Green highlights also surround the navigation array. The Renew is compact (4.4 inches tall by 1.8 inches wide by 0.6 inch thick) and lightweight, so it''s easy to carry around in a pocket or bag. Though its shell is entirely plastic, it feels somewhat solid in the hand. Still, this is not a phone for the danger-prone.

The Renew''s display is about what you''d expect from a basic handset--it''s small (1.44 inches, 128x128 pixels) and has a low resolution. With support for just 65,000-colors, graphics aren''t terribly sharp and most hues are muted. On the upside, the display is bright with readable text, but the brightness and font size can''t be changed. You can alter the backlight timer and choose from list and icon menu designs. Both interfaces follow Moto''s standard organizational system, which remains dated and a bit convoluted.

The navigation array consists of a four-way toggle with a central OK button, two soft keys, and the Talk and End/power buttons. The left soft key doubles as a music player shortcut and you can set the toggle to give one-touch-access to four user-defined features. Though the navigation controls are plastic, they don''t feel too flimsy and the arrangement is relatively spacious. Also, we like that the toggle is raised above the surface of the phone. We''d prefer a dedicated clear button and a speakerphone control, but that''s a minor point.

The keypad does well with its relatively cramped space. Though they''re flush, the individual buttons are clearly separated form each other and there''s a bright backlighting. Dialing by feel was a bit difficult at first, but we were able to text quickly after a short learning period.

The remaining controls are few; in fact, they''re a little too few. A 2.5mm headset jack and a Mini-USB/charger port sit conveniently on opposite sides of the phone, but the Renew doesn''t offer a dedicated volume rocker. That means you have to remove the phone from your face during a conversation so you can adjust the volume with the toggle. That''s not the most convenient arrangement. What''s more, the microSD card slot is stashed behind the battery.


The Renew''s box is made from recycled paper and the ink on the manual is soy-based.
You can tell instantly that the Renew''s brown packaging is made from recycled materials. It''s smaller than your average cell phone box (22 percent smaller, according to Moto) and it is devoid of any fancy graphics. It''s nothing more than a "feel-good" measure, but it''s a nice touch just the same. Just remember to go full circle and recycle your box.

Features
The Renew has a 500-contact phone book with room in each entry for six phone numbers and an e-mail address (the SIM card holds an additional 250 names). You can save callers to groups and pair them with one of 35 polyphonic ringtones. The Renew doesn''t offer photo caller ID, but we''re not going to raise a stink since the handset doesn''t have a camera. Other essentials include a vibrate mode, text and multimedia messaging, a speakerphone, a calculator, an alarm clock, USB syncing, a stopwatch, and support for T-Mobile''s My Faves service.

The Renew also offers a basic music player, which is a curious addition on a phone that doesn''t even have Bluetooth (indeed, we''d prefer the latter). The player''s staunchly minimalist interface, mediocre performance, and zero features make it not really worth the effort, but it''s there if you want it. Your best bet to transfer music is via the memory card slot, which supports cards up to 2GB.

You can personalize the Renew with a variety of screensavers, wallpaper, colors, and a greeting. You can download more options from T-Mobile''s t-zones service using the WAP 2.0 Web browser. The handset comes with two games: Tetris and Sudoku. You can buy more titles if you wish. Just be aware that gameplay is a bit tedious thanks to the phone''s slow processor.

Performance
We tested the dual-band (GSM 850/1900) Motorola W233 Renew in San Francisco using T-Mobile service. Since it lacks support for European GSM bands, the W233 will not work outside of North America. Also, data support is limited to GPRS.

Thanks to Moto''s CrystalTalk feature, which blocks out surrounding noise, the Renew offers better call quality than you might expect. We enjoyed a strong signal with clear audio and loud volume. Callers sounded natural, and we could hear them in noisy environments. Our only complaint was that we detected a slight hiss during some conversations, but it was a rare occurrence.

On their end, callers said we sounded fine. They also could hear and understand us in a variety of environments and they didn''t report any problems with static or interference. Automated calling systems could understand us most of the time, but it was best if we were in a quiet room. The speakerphone is good, but not great. It was loud enough, but voices had an echo on our side.

The Renew has a rated talk battery life of nine hours, which is quite high. Indeed, our tests showed a talk time of 9 hours and 54 minutes. The promised standby battery life is 18 days. According to FCC radiation tests, the Renew has a digital SARof 1.26 watts per kilogram.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:46' WHERE "id" = 94[0m

Nokia N85
Over the past few weeks, we''ve had several Nokia N series smartphones come through our office doors, including the Nokia N96, the Nokia N79, and now the Nokia N85. Like the rest, the N85 is a high-end smartphone that offers advanced multimedia capabilities, so for this review, we didn''t dwell on the shared features (for more details on the N85''s features, please read our full review of the Nokia N79. Instead, we focused on some of the N85''s differences and standout capabilities, including music and gaming. In some ways, we found it a better device than the Nokia N96 and the Nokia N95. While you lose a bit of internal memory, you do get most of the same features; the same dual-slider design but in a slimmer, sleeker package; and snappier performance--all for about $280 less, so if you''re in a dilemma of trying to decide among the three, we''d say the Nokia N85 is certainly the better value.

Design
The Nokia N85 is like a smaller, slimmer, and sexier version of the Nokia N96. The smartphone measures 4 inches tall by 1.9 inches wide by 0.6 inch deep and weighs 4.5 ounces (compared with 4.1 inches high by 2.2 inches wide by 0.7 inch deep and 4.4 ounces); compared with some other smartphones, the N85 is still on the thick side so it''ll make for a tight fit in a pants pocket, but it''s definitely better than the N95 and N96. The sleek, black chassis also gives the N85 a more attractive and modern look, and the smoother edges make it more comfortable to hold in the hand. More importantly, the smartphone has a solid construction. We''ve complained in the past about the Nokia N95 and the N96 feeling a bit cheap and plasticky, but that''s not the case with N85.


The Nokia N85 (left) shares a similar design to the Nokia N96 but is thinner and shorter.
Unlike the other N series models, the Nokia N85 features a 2.6-inch OLED display, rather than a TFT LCD. The screen supports up to 16.7 million colors at a 320x240-pixel resolution and when compared with the N96, the bump up in sharpness and brightness of color is quite noticeable. It really made photos, videos, and Web pages pop from the screen. As with most cell phone screens, however, the display was difficult to read under bright sunlight. As always, you can customize the home screen with various background images and themes.

Below the display, there are two soft keys, Talk and End buttons, a Menu shortcut, a multimedia key, a clear button, and a touch-sensitive navigation toggle. The latter can act as a jog wheel by choosing the Navi Wheel setting under Tools > Settings > General > Navi Wheel. Once on, you can simply touch the other edges of the toggle to scroll through menus, zoom in and out of pages, and so forth. However, we didn''t find it particularly responsive, so we turned it off and used the toggle in the more traditional way of pressing up, down, left or right to move in those directions. As for the rest of the navigation controls, the layout was roomy but we had difficulties with the two soft keys, clear and menu buttons since they were flat and stiff to press.


While the dialpad was pretty easy to use, we had problems with some of the navigation controls.
Like the N95 and N96, the Nokia N85 features a dual-slider design. To expose the alphanumeric keypad, just push the screen up. The buttons are flat but they''re not as stiff as the aforementioned keys and there''s enough room between to each number to make dialing and texting easy. On the flip side, by pushing the screen down, you''ll get access to the dedicated multimedia buttons. The track forward/back buttons also double as zoom in/out buttons in galleries.

On top of the unit, you''ll find a power button, a 3.5mm headphone/AV jack, and a MicroUSB port. The right side has a volume rocker, a lock switch, a camera button, and 3D stereo speakers, while the left side holds a MicroSD expansion slot, which is protected by an attached cover. We should note that it was quite difficult to insert and take out cards since the slot was set pretty deep beneath the phone''s surface. Finally, on back, you''ll find the camera lens, which is protected by a slider cover, and a dual LED flash.

The Nokia N85 comes packaged with a travel charger, a USB cable, video-out cables, an 8GB MicroSD card, a wired headset, a software CD, and reference material. For more add-ons, please check out cell phones accessories, ring tones, and help page.

Multimedia
While the Nokia N85 can handle all the multimedia duties of its N series siblings, Nokia particularly calls out its music, gaming, and Web experience. The built-in media player supports MP3, AAC, eACC, eACC+, and WMA files and offers repeat and shuffle modes. You can create playlists on the fly, and the smartphone will display album art if available. In addition to your personal library of tunes, the N85 offers podcast support and an FM radio, provided that you use the included earbuds since the tuner is built into them.


The N85 is equipped with a 3.5mm jack so you can enjoy your music through your favorite pair of headphones.
There''s a built-in equalizer with six settings: default, bass booster, classical, jazz, pop, and rock. We were impressed with the sound quality of the phone''s speakers, which offered fuller sound than most smartphones and a pretty decent balance between treble and bass. Even at lower volume levels, there was plenty of boom and, in fact, we found that quality deteriorated at the higher levels. Most of you will probably listen to your music through headphones so it''s good news that the N85 is equipped with a standard 3.5mm jack, so you can plug in your pair of earbuds or ''phones. We enjoyed our tunes with a pair of Bose On-Ear Headphones but we also used the included earbuds, as uncomfortable as they were, to try out the FM radio. We were able to tune into local radio stations with no problems and using the Visual Radio application, we were also able to see the song title and artist displayed on the screen, which was awesome.

As we noted in our Nokia N79 review, the Nokia Music Store has not fully launched in the United States and it feels as if company is no rush to get it out there, so we weren''t able to purchase and download any songs over the air like our friends across the pond.

We were able to check out Nokia''s N-Gage gaming service and downloaded several titles, including Tetris, Brain Challenge, FIFA 08, and System Rush Evolution. With the purchase of the N85, you get an activation code that will allow you to download the full version of one game for free; afterward, you''ll have to pay for each title, but you can download a free trial to test before making the full commitment to buy. The N-Gage platform isn''t just a place where you can buy games, however. There''s also a community aspect to it, where you can create a profile, build up points and status, and interact and play with other N-Gage members.

Download and installation of games typically took about a two minutes, and we encountered a couple of network problems when trying to download new games from the phone. Actual game play was decent, considering that we were using a phone. As we played System Rush Evolution, we were impressed at the smooth performance as we navigated a spaceship through various levels of combat. Again, remembering the fact that we were playing on a cell phone, graphics looked sharp, partly due to the N85''s OLED display. If anything, we had some difficult with the game control. You use the phone''s various navigations buttons for play, which was fine in some cases but not in others. For example, in FIFA 08, we found it somewhat difficult to maneuver the player using the navigation toggle, given the stiffness of the control. Though no replacement for your Sony PSP or Nintendo DS, the N85 is pretty decent stand-in for a handheld gaming device.


The N85''s 5-megapixel camera took some impressive photos.
Now as much focus is given to the features mentioned above, we also found the Nokia N85 to be a great camera phone. The device is equipped with the same 5-megapixel camera as the N79, with a Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens, dual LED flash, 20x digital zoom, video recording at up to 30 frames per second, and advanced editing options. Picture quality was sharp and bright, and there wasn''t much of a lag when trying to capture pictures. We weren''t as thrilled with recorded video clips, but it was better and smoother than a lot of the smartphones we''ve seen. To store all your images and other multimedia files, the Nokia N85 offers about 74MB of user accessible memory and the MicroSD expansion slot, which can accept up to 8GB cards.

Performance	
We tested the quad-band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900; 850/1900 HSDPA) Nokia N85 in San Francisco using AT&T service and call quality was quite good. On our end, we weren''t distracted by any background noise or echo and the audio had a nice clear and rich sound to it. Our friends reported positive results as well and we had no problems using an airline''s voice-automated system or dealt with any dropped calls. The speakerphone wasn''t quite as sharp as calls had a hollow sound to them. We successfully paired the N85 with the Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth headset and the Motorola S9 Bluetooth Active Headphones.

General performance was somewhat mixed comparatively speaking. The N85 wasn''t as snappy as the N79 but not as slow as the Nokia N96. The biggest delays came when trying to view photos, as it took the smartphone a few seconds to render pictures and get them into focus. However, the rest of the time, the N85 felt responsive and never crashed during our review period. The N85 was able to find and connect to our Wi-Fi network with no problem. It took about 25 seconds for the smartphone to load CNET''s full site, while it took about 5 seconds to bring up CNN''s and ESPN''s mobile sites. The N85''s Web browser is pretty easy to navigate despite the lack of a touch screen. There''s an onscreen cursor that makes it easy to click on links, and the minimap mode gives you an overview of the page to help you determine what section of the site you want to check out. You can also have multiple windows open, bookmark pages, block pop-ups, and more.

The Nokia N85 comes with a 1,200mAh lithium ion battery that has rated talk time 6.9 hours (4.5 hours on 3G) and up to 15 days of standby time. In our battery drain tests, the N85 was able to get 9.5 hours of continuous talk time on a single charge.

From the Verizon Wireless Blitz to the Pantech Matrix, it looks like almost every national carrier has some kind of messaging-centric handset. Sprint has answered the call with a few of their own, and one of them is the unusual-looking LG Lotus. Sporting a square shape similar to the Blitz, it has a sleek and stylish design that is quite attractive. It also has high-end features like EV-DO and access to all of Sprint''s 3G services. Perhaps the only niggling detail is its price-- the Lotus is $150 with a two-year service agreement. Sprint''s other messaging phone, the Samsung Rant, offers the same features as the Lotus, but is $100 less. That said, the Lotus is certainly better designed, so it''s your call on whether it''s worth the extra money.

Design
A recipient of the Red Dot Design Award, the design of the LG Lotus is what sets it apart from most other messaging phones. Sure the Verizon Wireless Blitz also has a square and compact shape, but the LG Lotus is not only small, it''s slim and sleek as well. Measuring 3.3 inches wide by 2.4 inches tall by 0.7 inch thick, the Lotus is surprisingly chic despite its squat appearance. It comes in both textured purple and satin black, and both give the Lotus a nice sheen. The Lotus weighs around 3.7 ounces and has a soft-touch finish, giving it a comfortable feel in the hand.


The LG Lotus has a full QWERTY keyboard.
Perhaps due to its wide body, the LG Lotus has a wider-than-average 1.4-inch external display, which supports up to 65,000 colors. You can adjust the screensaver and the clock, and that''s about it. It displays the usual date, time, battery, and signal strength information, plus it also displays music player information when the music player is activated. The display also acts as a self-portrait viewfinder when the camera is activated.
Underneath the display is a thin silver strip that is actually home to three dedicated music player keys. They are the previous track, play/pause, and next track keys. You can hardly see them when the music player isn''t activated, but when it is, the keys glow white. We appreciate that the keys are not touch-sensitive--unlike those of the LG Chocolate--but we wish there was some kind of texture difference between each key. Instead, the keys are completely flat and you need to look at what you''re doing to make sure you''re hitting the right one.

Right under the external music player keys are the Sprint logo, the camera lens, and the external speakers. To the left is the volume rocker and charger jack, while the right spine is home to a headset jack, a dedicated music player key, a dedicated camera key, and a microSD-card slot.


The LG Lotus has a 2.0-megapixel camera.
Flip open the Lotus and you''ll find a stunning 2.4-inch display that supports up to 262,000 colors. The wider display makes the Lotus ideal for viewing streaming video, and the color support helps make images and graphics look rich and vibrant. You can adjust the screen''s backlight time, the screensaver, and the image that appears whenever there''s an incoming call.
The Lotus comes with Sprint''s new One Click navigation interface. This consists of eight shortcut tiles along the bottom of the home screen, and each tile can become any of 14 shortcuts to applications. You can even have a shortcut that leads to other shortcuts. As you flip through, you will get a small pop-up menu of the application''s options. The Google tile, for example, pops up shortcuts to Google search, Google Maps, Gmail, and YouTube. You can also add a "bubble" to the home screen that either displays the latest headlines or your latest horoscope. We found the interface very intuitive and easy to use.

Underneath the display is the navigation array, which consists of two soft keys, a square toggle with middle Menu/OK key, a dedicated speakerphone key, a Back key, and the Talk and End/Power keys. Underneath that is a full QWERTY keyboard, complete with a dedicated Text messaging key. The QWERTY keyboard is one of the best we''ve ever tried on a messaging phone. The keys are well-spaced, and each key has a bubblelike texture that is raised above the surface of the phone. The navigation keys are also roomy and easy to press.

Features
The LG Lotus is not just a messaging phone-- it also comes with a host of multimedia and high-end features. But before we get to that, let''s start with the basics. The Lotus has a 600-contact phone book, with room in each entry for six phone numbers, two e-mail addresses, an instant-messenger handle, a Web address, and notes. You can save contacts to groups, and pair them with a photo, any of 35 polyphonic ringtones, and any of four vibrations for caller ID. Other essentials include text and multimedia messaging, an alarm clock, a calculator, a scheduler, a voice memo recorder, a notepad, and a world clock. More advanced users will like the USB mode for PC syncing, voice command, instant messaging, e-mail, stereo Bluetooth, a mobile Web browser, and a document viewer. It also has A-GPS, which supports the Sprint Navigation and Sprint Family Locator services.

The Lotus comes equipped with EV-DO, allowing it access to Sprint''s Power Vision. This includes Sprint TV for live on-demand television shows, Sprint Movies for on-demand movies, and Sprint Radio for streaming radio from more than 150 stations. Of course, as a multimedia phone, the Lotus also has access to the Sprint Music Store for wireless music downloads.

Speaking of music, the Lotus''s music player is simple, but functional. You can either purchase songs over the air like we mentioned or transfer songs via USB. The player interface is pretty generic, with options for repeat, shuffle, and creating and editing playlists. You can send the music player to the background while doing other things like texting. The Lotus comes with 80MB of built-in memory, and if that''s not enough, the microSD-card slot allows for additional storage.


The Lotus takes good photos.
The Lotus has a 2.0-megapixel camera, which can take pictures in four resolutions (1,600x1200, 1,280x960, 640x480, and 320x240), and three quality settings. Other camera options include brightness, white balance, spot metering, a night mode, five color tones, a self-timer, multishot, fun frames, a 4x zoom, four shutter sounds, plus a silent option. The built-in camcorder has editing options similar to that on the still camera. We liked the photo quality; images looked clear and sharp, but we did notice the colors appeared darker than usual.

You can personalize the Lotus in a number of ways. You can select different kinds of graphics for wallpaper and screensavers, different sounds for ringtones and alerts, and full games and applications as well. The Lotus comes with three games: Guitar Hero III, a demo version of JewelQuest2, and Space Monkey. It also comes with four applications: Google Maps, Loopt, NASCAR Sprint cup Mobile, and Social Zone. You can download more of these personalization options via the Sprint browser.

Performance
We tested the LG Lotus in San Francisco on Sprint''s network. We were very impressed with the call quality overall. Callers sounded crisp and clear, without a lot of static. Speakerphone calls were quite good as well, albeit on the tinnier side. On their end, callers said we sounded loud and clear as well, though the voices sounded rather robotic, and they could still tell we were on a cell phone. Automated-calling systems recognized our voices just fine in a quiet room. Bluetooth calls were successful.

Music quality was decent. Bass was a little weak, but the melody and vocals sounded alright. We would recommend using a headset for better audio quality. EV-DO speeds were great. Streaming video from Sprint''s PowerVision had no buffering issues. Video quality is similar to other Sprint TV phones. While typing out text messages, we found that text sometimes lagged behind our typing. This isn''t a huge issue, but when it happened, we thought it was rather annoying.

The Lotus has a rated battery life of 5.6 hours talk time. Our tests reveal a talk time of 3 hours and 36 minutes. According to FCC radiation tests, the Lotus has a digital SAR rating of 1.360 watts per kilogram.', "updated_at" = '2009-08-16 22:53:46' WHERE "id" = 99[0m
