In that time span ,  the company has issued another handset ( the small ,  less powerful Pixi ) ,  released a number of over-the-air updates to its OS ( nine in all ) ,  and created and disseminated a slew of developer tools ,  including iterative releases of its SDK and a new web-based development environment called Ares .  Throughout the ups and downs of the past 12-or-so months Palm has been “back, "  the company has stuck with Sprint as its lone carrier partner in the US — so while it 's been innovating and tweaking on its platform and devices ,  the third-place partner has kept it from the larger audiences AT&T or Verizon might offer .  Now — almost a year to the day — Palm has turned around and opened its devices up to the country 's largest carrier ,  in addition to bumping the specs and features of both phones it offers ( the Pre getting an additional 8GB of storage and double the RAM ,  the Pixi is now equipped with WiFi ) .  All the while significantly improving its SDK ( with the new native Plug-in Development Kit ) and app distribution model .  So can Palm finally really get this ship sailing ,  court the developers it badly needs ,  and deliver on the promises of webOS ,  or is it too little ,  too late ?  Read on to find out !

In fact ,  as a primer to this review ,  we suggest you take a look at our encyclopedic rundown of the Pre and webOS ,  and our more recent Pixi review for the basics .  We'll concentrate on the Pre Plus here ,  since it 's undergone the most significant and noticeable changes ( both externally and internally ) .

Most noticeable is the removal of the “home "  button from the front of the Pre ,  and a slight change to its keyboard which makes the keys a bit clickier and less gel-like .  Palm also says it 's altered the hinge mechanism and updated the build quality of the phone — that seems to be true ,  though there are still issues to be found .  The Pixi Plus is — for all intents and purposes — identical to its Sprint cousin ,  save for its new Verizon branding and the inclusion of WiFi .  As far as looks go ,  this should all seem very familiar to those of you who've checked out the Sprint Pre .  That physical home button has been replaced with a thin LED slit ,  just like the Pixi ,  and in general we don't see it as much of a change ,  though we did miss the tactile feel of the physical button now and again .  Even if it didn't get a lot done ,  the click was nice to hear .  The new style certainly goes a way to retain the “polished stone "  design motif which the company has touted ,  and we can't complain too much about clean ,  unbroken surfaces on our gadgets .  Palm also says that the hinge for the slider mechanism ( a pain point on older models of the phone ) has been improved as well ,  and in our tests it does seem a bit tighter ,  though we noticed that when we used the phone with the keyboard open ,  it seemed to want to slide shut a bit easier than the previous version .  Additionally ,  the company has altered the keyboard to be a bit more stiff and plasticky ( a la the Pixi ) ,  though it 's by no means as clicky as we'd like it to be .  The overall effect is minor ,  and coupled with the fact that the company has yet to really tighten up its word correction / prediction ,  typing on the Pre still takes some getting used to .  We're also not sold on the new monochromatic color scheme for the keyboard — being able to clearly see the orange number keys was a nice little touch ,  now it 's a bit of a challenge to find the digits .  Otherwise ,  changes are nonexistent ,  even down to the cheap ,  plastic cover which Palm uses on the MicroUSB door here — we broke the first one on our original Sprint test unit ,  and every time we pull the thing up ,  it feels precarious .  We wish they'd gone in the direction of the Pixi with this ( a small flap which doesn't have to be pushed into place ) .  Overall ,  it 's the same Pre you know and / or love .  Palm took smarter steps with the industrial design of the Pixi — which feels like a more solid phone — and we wish they'd have put some of that juice into a new version of the Pre .

The former gets a much-needed storage boost to 16GB ,  plus the RAM has been doubled in the Verizon version .  The Pixi doesn't change at all save for the inclusion of WiFi ,  which admittedly makes the phone much more desirable ,  even for those not in need of data-heavy sessions .  On the Pre ,  we saw a notable increase in the amount of cards we could have open at a single time ,  and with ten separate apps up ,  we were still able to load Need for Speed :  Undercover — an impressive feat no matter how you slice it .  We certainly found that memory errors ( warnings to kill some cards ) were far less prevalent than on the Sprint version ,  though the RAM increase doesn't seem to alter the loading of long lists — we still got the annoying “loading "  message when quickly scrolling through our contacts .  Luckily ,  since finding a contact on a webOS device is painless ,  we barely ever had to touch that list .

The Pre produced shrilly ,  almost painful mid-rangey tones ,  while the Pixi was much smoother and pleasant .  Here 's hoping Palm makes some changes in this area on upcoming hardware… though we've been spoiled by the Droid when it comes to sound on cellphones .

Unfortunately ,  1.4 isn't slated for release until February ,  and the devices we received for testing are both running 1.3.5.1 — the same version we have on our Sprint phones .  That 's not to say there aren't some differences ;  thankfully ( and naturally ) the NFL ,  Nascar ,  Sprint Navigation ,  and Sprint TV apps are gone from the device .  Only the navigation is replaced ,  with Verizon 's hand-rolled turn-by-turn standing in here ,  and we have to say ,  it 's a distant second place .  We greatly preferred Sprint 's GPS software ,  even if Verizon Navigator offers a lot more in terms of location info ,  news ,  and weather .  Also different here is the inclusion of the new Mobile Hotspot app ,  an amazing little piece of software that allows you to use your Pre or Pixi as a connection point where up to five devices can latch onto the network via WiFi .  In our testing ,  the software worked flawlessly and was super easy to setup ,  meaning if you're a road warrior and you've got one of these devices ,  you might be able to leave the 3G card at home ( though we suggest you bring an extra battery for your phone… or two ) .  Oh ,  one hitch — you'll have to cough up an additional $40 for the use of the hotspot ,  with a 5GB cap and a $.05 per MB charge after that .  It might be cheaper than a 3G card plan… but not much .  Besides that inclusion ,  the software is the familiar version you probably know .  Now ,  Palm has done a series of updates ( as we noted in the intro ) ,  and the company has taken pains to add much-needed features and squash bugs .  Unfortunately ,  we've been reminded about what is missing in webOS during our testing much more than we've been surprised by the additions ( of course ,  we've also been tracking these updates closely ) .  We're still waiting for basic inclusions in the software ,  like the ability to set our own notification tone ( and set it for different alerts ) ,  better word prediction and correction on the keyboard ,  multiple message management in the email app ( really guys ?  ) ,  a decent way to manage Synergy contacts and calendars ,  and a handful of other obvious changes that we have yet to see ( we won't even get into our plea for threaded emails ) .  And then there 's the issue of consistency and speed — for a phone which boasts a CPU as powerful as the iPhone 3GS ,  you certainly don't see it shine here like you expect it to .  Applications still take longer than they should to open ,  and we still saw some lag during heavy use .  We also take issue with notifications on webOS — the little pop-ups are handy ,  but compared with Android ,  Palm still has a ways to go towards making them manageable .  When you get four or five messages at a time ,  things can get a little hairy .  And it needs to be said :  the mail application is just not that good .  It really needs some TLC from Palm .

In particular ,  the battery life on the Pre is just awful when put through a day of heavy use .  In our initial review ,  we noted you probably couldn't get through a full day ,  but now it feels like you might not even get through an afternoon .  On one lengthier call ( about 50 minutes ) ,  we watched our battery life dip from 67 percent to 24 percent .  That 's just unacceptable as far as we're concerned — this is an issue that must be addressed by the company if it keeps pushing these data-heavy services .

Sure ,  there are those lingering issues ,  but webOS is also a tremendous mobile operating system which allows you to handle lots of little tasks at once ,  and doesn't buckle under what we consider to be a tremendous amount of pressure .  Even when running ten cards or more ,  the Pre Plus still felt snappy and usable ,  and made us remember just how much fun — and useful — webOS can be .  Android and the iPhone OS may have their killer features ,  but neither one of them can handle multitasking like the Pre and Pixi — and while the latter isn't as fast as we would like it to be ,  both phones still perform admirably with a lot of balls in the air .  This is a powerful and creative mobile OS with tons of potential ,  and it seems like Palm is just starting to tap into that .

With the new tools for developers ,  app-makers will be able to create the same content- and graphically-rich applications that they would for say… the iPhone .  We've already seen this demonstrated in the form of a handful of 3D games now available for the Pre ( sorry Pixi users — you're out in the cold here ) .  As a first pass at gaming on the Pre ,  the offerings are excellent .  While we noticed a slightly lower frame rate when compared side-by-side with the iPhone 3GS ,  they still held their own .  Graphically ,  we couldn't see much of a difference ,  though the Pre 's smaller screen squashed some of the details out of scenery .  Small issues notwithstanding ,  the crop of applications using the PDK show enormous potential for webOS .  Provided Palm gets these tools into the hands of developers and lets them go crazy ,  we could see some fascinating new software for this platform .

On the data side ,  we were impressed with the speed of page loads ,  and doubly impressed to see that same bandwidth passed along to other devices while using the Mobile Hotspot app .  You really can't beat Verizon 's network for sheer robustness here in the US — a situation we hope some other carriers will rectify in the near future .  No one likes a monopoly on bandwidth .  As far as pricing is concerned ,  Verizon isn't breaking any new ground with the Pre Plus and Pixi Plus .  The devices will be available for $149.99 and $99.99 ,  respectively ,  with a two-year contract and mail-in $100 rebate .  If you're smart and buy the devices online ,  you get that rebate instantly ,  and Verizon is also offering a buy-one-get-one deal through February 14th which lets you pick up a free Pixi Plus with the purchase of either device .

In fact ,  it 's barely a bump at all .  If you've just purchased one of these devices on Sprint ,  you may feel a little sting ,  but don't let it get to you — they're not markedly better on Verizon — especially the Pixi .  In fact ,  we're just going to say if you're reading Engadget and serious about finding your next smartphone ,  just count the Pixi out .  With a mere $50 price difference ,  there is no possible way we could recommend the inferior device to readers .  When you factor in the increased storage ,  RAM ,  and processing power of the Pre Plus ,  the Pixi looks outrageously unattractive ( even though ,  honestly ,  we think it 's really physically attractive ) .  So let 's just talk about the Pre Plus for a moment .

It should be obvious that as a smartphone buyer ,  you have some amazing options right now .  If you're a Verizon customer ,  you can get the excellent Droid ,  or wait for the forthcoming Nexus One ,  to say nothing of the BlackBerry offerings on the network ( if that 's your cup of tea ) .  If you're carrier independent ,  then your choice is even harder — T-Mobile ,  Sprint ,  and AT&T offer a stack of seriously great phones that would make even the pickiest geek happy .  So why choose the Pre Plus on Verizon ?  To answer that question ,  you have to figure out if you believe in the potential of webOS devices ;  Palm doesn't have the fastest phone ,  or the phone with the highest resolution ,  certainly not the biggest app selection ,  and it doesn't have a massive community behind it .  What it does have ,  however ,  is a brilliant platform with huge potential to change the way you work and live with your phone ( provided they tap that potential soon… as in now ) .  If you're as hopeful as we are that that potential will be fulfilled ,  your decision should be a simple one .
