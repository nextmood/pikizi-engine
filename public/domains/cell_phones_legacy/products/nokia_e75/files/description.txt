Nokia has released the E75 smartphone, doing its best to please enterprise users and keep them away from RIM’s BlackBerry or the upcoming Palm Pre. It’s the first Nokia device to ship with the company’s new e-mail user interface – making multiple accounts easy to manage — as well as full integration of e-mail and messaging.

The Nokia E75 smartphone for business users has arrived in stores.   It’s the first Nokia device to ship with the company’s new e-mail user interface, which offers a standard desktop e-mail experience — one-click reply, subfolders, HTML support, the ability to open attachments — on a 4.8-ounce device running Symbian S60 third edition software.   The E75 is an enterprise-focused device, and so there’s support for Mail for Microsoft Exchange and IBM Lotus Notes Traveler, but the same account can also host accounts from consumer services such as Yahoo Mail, Google Gmail and Microsoft Windows Live Hotmail. 
For easy e-mailing, a full qwerty keyboard slides out from behind a 2.4-inch QVGA screen, which can be customized for two different home screen modes, for those wanting to better differentiate between work and play.   The quad-band phone supports GSM and WCDMA connectivity (850/900/1800/1900, WCDMA, 850/1900/2100 HSDPA) as well as VOIP (voice over IP) over WLAN.    There’s Bluetooth 2.0 inside, 5 MB of internal dynamic memory, a microSD slot for 16 GB more, the Nokia Maps A-GPS navigation application, music and media players, an FM radio and a 3.2-megabyte camera with red-eye reduction, LED flash and eight-times digital zoom.
